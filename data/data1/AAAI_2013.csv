8,2013,Main Technical Papers,Sensitivity of Diffusion Dynamics to Network Uncertainty,"Abhijin Adiga, Chris Kuhlman, Henning Mortveit, Anil Kumar S Vullikanti","Simple diffusion processes on networks have been used to model, analyze and predict diverse phenomena such as spread of diseases, information and memes. More often than not, the underlying network data is noisy and sampled. This prompts the following natural question: how sensitive are the diffusion dynamics and subsequent conclusions to uncertainty in the network structure?  In this paper, we consider two popular diffusion models: Independent cascades (IC) model and Linear threshold (LT) model. We study how the expected number of vertices that are influenced/infected, given some initial conditions, are affected by network perturbation. By rigorous analysis under the assumption of a reasonable perturbation model we establish the following main results. (1) For the IC model, we characterize the susceptibility to network perturbation in terms of the critical probability for phase transition of the network. We find the expected number of infections is quite stable, unless the the transmission probability is close to the critical probability. (2) We show that the standard LT model with uniform edge weights is relatively stable under network perturbations.  (3) Empirically, the transient behavior, i.e., the time series of the number of infections, in both models appears to be more sensitive to network perturbations. We also study these questions using extensive simulations on diverse real world networks, and find that our theoretical predictions for both models match the empirical observations quite closely.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6465/7040,Diffusion on graphs; Independent cascades model; Linear threshold model; Network sampling; Network perturbation; Submodularity
9,2013,Main Technical Papers,A Morphogenetically Assisted Design Variation Tool,"Aaron Adler, Fusun Yaman, Jacob Beal, Jeffrey Cleveland, Hala Mostafa, Annan Mozeika","The complexity and tight integration of electromechanical systems often makes them ""brittle"" and hard to modify in response to changing requirements.  We aim to remedy this by capturing expert knowledge as functional blueprints, an idea inspired by regulatory processes that occur in natural morphogenesis.  We then apply this knowledge in an intelligent design variation tool. When a user modifies a design, our tool uses functional blueprints to modify other components in response, thereby maintaining integration and reducing the need for costly search or constraint solving. In this paper, we refine the functional blueprint concept and discuss practical issues in applying it to electromechanical systems. We then validate our approach with a case study applying our prototype tool to create variants of a miniDroid robot and by empirical evaluation of convergence dynamics of networks of functional blueprints.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6408/7043,Morphogenetic Engineering; functional blue prints
10,2013,Main Technical Papers,Truncated Incremental Search: Faster Replanning by Exploiting Suboptimality,"Sandip Aine, Maxim Likhachev","Incremental heuristic searches try to reuse their previous search efforts whenever these are available. As a result, they can often solve a sequence of similar planning problems much faster than planning from scratch. State-of-the-art incremental heuristic searches such as LPA*, D* and D* Lite all work by propagating cost changes to all the states on the search tree whose g-values (the costs of computed paths from the start) are no longer optimal. While such a complete propagation of cost changes is required to ensure optimality, the propagations can be stopped much earlier if we are looking for solutions within a given suboptimality bound. We present a framework called Truncated Incremental Search that builds on this observation, and uses a target suboptimality bound to efficiently restrict the cost propagations. Using this framework, we develop two algorithms, Truncated LPA* (TLPA*) and Truncated D* Lite (TD* Lite). We discuss their analytical properties and present experimental results for 2D and 3D (x, y, heading) path planning that show significant improvement in runtime over existing incremental heuristic searches when searching for close-to-optimal solutions. In addition, unlike typical incremental searches, Truncated Incremental Search is much less dependent on the proximity of the cost changes to the goal of the search due to the early termination of the cost change propagation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6446/7048,Incremental Search; Heuristic Search; Path Planning
11,2013,Main Technical Papers,Interdependent Multi-Issue Negotiation for Energy Exchange in Remote Communities,"Muddasser Alam, Alex Rogers, Sarvapali D Ramchurn","We present a novel negotiation protocol to facilitate energy exchange between off-grid homes that are equipped with renewable energy generation and electricity storage. Our protocol imposes restrictions over negotiation such that it reduces the complex interdependent multi-issue negotiation to one  where agents have a strategy profile in subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We show that our negotiation protocol is tractable, concurrent, scalable and leads to Pareto-optimal outcomes in a decentralised manner. We empirically evaluate our protocol and show that, in this instance, a society of agents can (i) improve the overall utilities by 14% and (ii) reduce their overall use of the batteries by 37%.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6340/7051,Complex Negotiation; Interdependent Issues; Energy Exchange; Remote communities; Smart Home
12,2013,Main Technical Papers,Multi-Cycle Query Caching in Agent Programming,"Natasha Alechina, Tristan Behrens, Mehdi Dastani, Koen Hindriks, Jomi Hubner, Brian Logan, Hai Nguyen, Marc van Zee","In many logic-based BDI agent programming languages, plan selection involves inferencing over some underlying knowledge representation. While context-sensitive plan selection facilitates the development of flexible, declarative programs, the overhead of evaluating repeated queries to the agent's beliefs and goals can result in poor run time performance. In this paper we present an approach to multi-cycle query caching for logic-based BDI agent programming languages. We extend the abstract performance model presented in (Alechina et al. 2012) to quantify the costs and benefits of caching query results over multiple deliberation cycles. We also present results of experiments with prototype implementations of both single- and multi-cycle caching in three logic-based BDI agent platforms, which demonstrate that significant performance improvements are achievable in practice.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6348/7054,BDI agent programming languages
13,2013,Main Technical Papers,Bundling Attacks in Judgment Aggregation,"Noga Alon, Dvir Falik, Reshef Meir, Moshe Tennenholtz","We consider judgment aggregation over multiple independent issues, where the chairperson has her own opinion, and can try to bias the outcome by bundling several issues together. Since for each bundle judges must give a uniform answer on all issues, different partitions of the issues may result in an outcome that significantly differs from the ""true,"" issue-wise, decision.   We prove that the bundling problem faced by the chairperson, i.e. trying to bias the outcome towards her own opinion, is computationally difficult in the worst case. Then we study the probability that an effective bundling attack exists as the disparity between the opinions of the judges and the chair varies. We show that if every judge initially agrees with the chair on every issue with probability of at least 1/2, then there is almost always a bundling attack (i.e. a partition) where the opinion of the chair on all issues is approved. Moreover, such a partition can be found efficiently. In contrast, when the probability is lower than 1/2 then the chair cannot force her opinion using bundling even on a single issue.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6332/7057,lobbying; bundling;   manipulation
14,2013,Main Technical Papers,A Pattern Matching Based Model for Implicit Opinion Question Identiﬁcation,"Hadi Amiri, Zheng-Jun Zha, Tat-Seng Chua","This paper presents the results of developing subjectivity classifiers for Implicit Opinion Question (IOQ) identification. IOQs are defined as opinion questions with no opinion words. An IOQ example is ""will the U.S. government pay more attention to the Pacific Rim?"" Our analysis on community questions of Yahoo! Answers shows that a large proportion of opinion questions are IOQs. It is thus important to develop techniques to identify such questions. In this research, we first propose an effective framework based on mutual information and sequential pattern mining to construct an opinion lexicon that not only contains opinion words but also patterns. The discovered words and patterns are then combined with a machine learning technique to identify opinion questions. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6324/7059,"sentiment analysis, opinion question, implicit opinion question, subjectivity"
15,2013,Main Technical Papers,Fast Equilibrium Computation for Infinitely Repeated Games,"Garrett Andersen, Vincent Conitzer","It is known that an equilibrium of an infinitely repeated two-player game (with limit average payoffs) can be computed in polynomial time, as follows: according to the folk theorem, we compute minimax strategies for both players to calculate the punishment values, and subsequently find a mixture over outcomes that exceeds these punishment values. However, for very large games, even computing minimax strategies can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic framework for computing equilibria of repeated games that does not require linear programming and that does not necessarily need to inspect all payoffs of the game. This algorithm necessarily sometimes fails to compute an equilibrium, but we mathematically demonstrate that most of the time it succeeds quickly on uniformly random games, and experimentally demonstrate this for other classes of games. This also holds for games with more than two players, for which no efficient general algorithms are known.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6215/7062,game theory; nash equilibrium; folk theorem; repeated games
16,2013,Main Technical Papers,On the Social Welfare of Mechanisms for Repeated Batch Matching,"Elliot Anshelevich, Meenal Chhabra, Sanmay Das, Matthew Gerrior","We study hybrid online-batch matching problems, where agents arrive  continuously, but are only matched in periodic rounds, when many of  them can be considered simultaneously. Agents not getting matched in  a given round remain in the market for the next round. This setting  models several scenarios of interest, including many job markets as  well as kidney exchange mechanisms. We consider the social utility  of two commonly used mechanisms for such markets: one that aims for  stability in each round (greedy), and one that attempts to maximize  social utility in each round (max-weight). Surprisingly, we find  that in the long term, the social utility of the greedy mechanism can be higher than that of the max-weight mechanism. We hypothesize  that this is because the greedy mechanism behaves similarly to a  soft threshold mechanism, where all connections below a certain  threshold are rejected by the participants in favor of waiting until  the next round. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method  to approximately calculate the optimal threshold for an individual  agent to use based on characteristics of the other agents  participating, and demonstrate experimentally that social utility is  high when all agents use this strategy. Thresholding can also be  applied by the mechanism itself to improve social welfare; we  demonstrate this with an example on graphs that model pairwise  kidney exchange.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6431/7063,Kidney-exchange; Online batch matching; Greedy matching; Stable matching; Threshold mechanisms
17,2013,Main Technical Papers,Equilibria of Online Scheduling Algorithms,"Itai Ashlagi, Brendan Lucier, Moshe Tennenholtz","We describe a model for competitive online scheduling algorithms. Two servers, each with a single observable queue, compete for customers. Upon arrival, each customer strategically chooses the queue with minimal expected wait time. Each scheduler wishes to maximize its number of customers, and can strategically select which scheduling algorithm, such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), to use for its queue. This induces a game played by the servers and the customers. We consider a non-Bayesian setting, where servers and customers play to maximize worst-case payoffs. We show that there is a unique subgame perfect safety-level equilibrium and we describe the associated scheduling algorithm (which is not FCFS). The uniqueness result holds for both randomized and deterministic algorithms, with a different equilibrium algorithm in each case. When the goal of the servers is to minimize competitive ratio, we prove that it is an equilibrium for each server to apply FCFS: each server obtains the optimal competitive ratio of 2.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6370/7068,Online Games; Equilibrium Analysis; Scheduling Algorithms; Competitive Queues; Non-Bayesian Equilibria
18,2013,Main Technical Papers,Ties Matter: Complexity of Manipulation when Tie-Breaking with a Random Vote,"Haris Aziz, Serge Gaspers, Nicholas Mattei, Nina Narodytska, Toby Walsh","We study the impact on strategic voting of tie-breaking by means of considering the order of tied candidates within a random vote. We compare this to another non deterministic tie-breaking rule where we simply choose candidate uniformly at random. In general, we demonstrate that there is no connection between the computational complexity of computing a manipulating vote with the two different types of tie-breaking. However, we prove that for some scoring rules, the computational complexity of computing a manipulation can increase from polynomial to NP-hard. We also discuss the relationship with the computational complexity of computing a manipulating vote when we ask for a candidate to be the unique winner, or to be among the set of co-winners.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6489/7069,voting; social choice; manipulation; strategic voting; tie-breaking
19,2013,Main Technical Papers,Optimal Coalition Structure Generation in Cooperative Graph Games,"Yoram Bachrach, Pushmeet Kohli, Vladimir Kolmogorov, Morteza Zadimoghaddam","Representation languages for coalitional games are a key research area in algorithmic game theory. There is an inherent tradeoff between how general a language is, allowing it to capture more elaborate games, and how hard it is computationally to optimize and solve such games. One prominent such language is the simple yet expressive Weighted Graph Games (WGGs) representation (Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994), which maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge weighted graph.    We consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in WGGs. The agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition is the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. The optimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that maximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that finding the optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is also intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are amenable for many other combinatorial problems. We then provide algorithms with constant factor approximations for planar, minor-free and bounded degree graphs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6407/7071,Cooperative Games; Graph Games; Coalition Structure Generation; Approximation Algorithms
20,2013,Main Technical Papers,Pruning for Monte Carlo Distributed Reinforcement Learning in Decentralized POMDPs,Bikramjit Banerjee,"Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) offer a powerful modeling technique for realistic multi-agent coordination problems under uncertainty. Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and assume prior knowledge of the model. Recently a Monte Carlo based distributed reinforcement learning approach was proposed, where agents take turns to learn best responses to each other’s policies. This promotes decentralization of the policy computation problem, and relaxes reliance on the full knowledge of the problem parameters. However, this Monte Carlo approach has a large sample complexity, which we address in this paper. In particular, we propose and analyze a modified version of the previous algorithm that adaptively eliminates parts of the experience tree from further exploration, thus requiring fewer samples while ensuring unchanged confidence in the learned value function. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in sample complexity – the maximum reductions ranging from 61% to 91% over different benchmark Dec-POMDP problems – with the final policies being often better due to more focused exploration.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6439/7073,Decentralized Planning; Reinforcement Learning; Monte Carlo Tree Search
21,2013,Main Technical Papers,Causal Transportability with Limited Experiments,"Elias Bareinboim, Judea Pearl","We address the problem of transferring causal knowledge learned in one environment to another, potentially different environment, when only limited experiments may be conducted at the source. This generalizes the treatment of transportability introduced in [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011; Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012b], which deals with transferring causal information when any experiment can be conducted at the source. Given that it is not always feasible to conduct certain controlled experiments, we consider the decision problem whether experiments on a selected subset Z of variables together with qualitative assumptions encoded in a diagram may render causal effects in the target environment computable from the available data. This problem, which we call z-transportability, reduces to ordinary transportability when Z is all-inclusive, and, like the latter, can be given syntactic characterization using the do-calculus [Pearl, 1995; 2000]. This paper establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for causal effects in the target domain to be estimable from both the non-experimental information available and the limited experimental information transferred from the source. We further provides a complete algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of fusing experimental and observational information to synthesize an unbiased estimate of the desired causal relation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6473/7075,causal relations; transfer knowledge; transportability; completeness; meta-analysis; experimental design
22,2013,Main Technical Papers,Teamwork with Limited Knowledge of Teammates,"Samuel Barrett, Peter Stone, Sarit Kraus, Avi Rosenfeld","While great strides have been made in multiagent teamwork, existing approaches typically assume extensive information exists about teammates and how to coordinate actions.  This paper addresses how robust teamwork can still be created even if limited or no information exists about a specific group of teammates, as in the ad hoc teamwork scenario.  The main contribution of this paper is the first empirical evaluation of an agent cooperating with teammates not created by the authors, where the agent is not provided expert knowledge of its teammates.  For this purpose, we develop a general-purpose teammate modeling method and test the resulting ad hoc team agent's ability to collaborate with more than 40 unknown teams of agents to accomplish a benchmark task.  These agents were designed by people other than the authors without these designers planning for the ad hoc teamwork setting.  A secondary contribution of the paper is a new transfer learning algorithm, TwoStageTransfer, that can improve results when the ad hoc team agent does have some limited observations of its current teammates.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6418/7078,"Ad Hoc Teams, Multiagent Systems, Teamwork"
23,2013,Main Technical Papers,Teaching Classification Boundaries to Humans,"Sumit Basu, Janara Christensen","Given a classification task, what is the best way to teach the resulting boundary to a human? While machine learning techniques can provide excellent methods for finding the boundary, including the selection of examples in an online setting, they tell us little about how we would teach a human the same task. We propose to investigate the problem of example selection and presentation in the context of teaching humans, and explore a variety of mechanisms in the interests of finding what may work best. In particular, we begin with the baseline of random presentation and then examine combinations of several mechanisms: the indication of an example’s relative difficulty, the use of the shaping heuristic from the cognitive science literature (moving from easier examples to harder ones), and a novel kernel-based “coverage model” of the subject’s mastery of the task. From our experiments on 54 human subjects learning and performing a pair of synthetic classification tasks via our teaching system, we found that we can achieve the greatest gains with a combination of shaping and the coverage model.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6359/7079,classification; teaching classification; human learning; curriculum learning
24,2013,Main Technical Papers,Social Rankings in Human-Computer Committees,"Moshe Bitan, Ya’akov Gal, Sarit Kraus, Elad Dokow, Amos Azaria","Despite committees and elections being widespread in thereal-world, the design of agents for operating in humancomputer committees has received far less attention than thetheoretical analysis of voting strategies. We address this gapby providing an agent design that outperforms other voters ingroups comprising both people and computer agents. In oursetting participants vote by simultaneously submitting a ranking over a set of candidates and the election system uses a social welfare rule to select a ranking that minimizes disagreements with participants’ votes. We ran an extensive studyin which hundreds of people participated in repeated votingrounds with other people as well as computer agents that differed in how they employ strategic reasoning in their votingbehavior. Our results show that over time, people learn todeviate from truthful voting strategies, and use heuristics toguide their play, such as repeating their vote from the previous round. We show that a computer agent using a bestresponse voting strategy was able to outperform people in thegame. Our study has implication for agent designers, highlighting the types of strategies that enable agents to succeedin committees comprising both human and computer participants. This is the ﬁrst work to study the role of computeragents in voting settings involving both human and agent participants.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6331/7083,Human Computer Interaction; AI and Social Science; Social Choise
25,2013,Main Technical Papers,Decoupling the Multiagent Disjunctive Temporal Problem,"James Calvin Boerkoel Jr., Edmund H. Durfee","The Multiagent Disjunctive Temporal Problem (MaDTP) is a general constraint-based formulation for scheduling problems that involve interdependent agents.  Decoupling agents' interdependent scheduling problems, so that each agent can manage its schedule independently, requires agents to adopt additional local constraints that effectively subsume their interdependencies.  In this paper, we present the first algorithm for decoupling MaDTPs.  Our distributed algorithm is provably sound and complete.  Our experiments show that the relative efficiency of using temporal decoupling to find solution spaces for MaDTPs, compared to algorithms that find complete solution spaces, improves with the interconnectedness between agents schedules, leading to orders of magnitude relative speeedup.  However, decoupling by its nature restricts agents' scheduling flexibility; we define novel flexibility metrics for MaDTPs, and show empirically how the flexibility sacrificed depends on the degree of coupling between agents' schedules.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6275/7084,Multiagent Scheduling; Distributed Scheduling; Temporal Decoupling; Disjunctive Temporal Problem
26,2013,Main Technical Papers,Qualitative Planning under Partial Observability in Multi-Agent Domains,"Ronen Brafman, Guy Shani, Shlomo Zilberstein","Decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDPs) provide a rich, attractive model for planning under uncertainty and partial observability in cooperative multi-agent domains with a growing body of research. In this paper we formulate a qualitative, propositional model for multi-agent planning under uncertainty with partial observability, which we call Qualitative Dec-POMDP (QDec-POMDP). We show that the worst-case complexity of planning in QDec-POMDPs is similar to that of Dec-POMDPs. Still, because the model is more “classical” in nature, it is more compact and easier to specify. Furthermore, it eases the adaptation of methods used in classical and contingent planning to solve problems that challenge current Dec-POMDPs solvers. In particular, in this paper we describe a method based on compilation to classical planning, which handles multi-agent planning problems significantly larger than those handled by current Dec-POMDP algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6388/7085,Contingent Planning;DEc-POMDP;Partial Observability

Procaccia","It is well known that strategic behavior in elections is essentially unavoidable; we therefore ask: how bad can the rational outcome be? We answer this question via the notion of the price of anarchy, using the scores of alternatives as a proxy for their quality and bounding the ratio between the score of the optimal alternative and the score of the winning alternative in Nash equilibrium. Specifically, we are interested in Nash equilibria that are obtained via sequences of rational strategic moves. Focusing on three common voting rules — plurality, veto, and Borda — we provide very positive results for plurality and very negative results for Borda, and place veto in the middle of this spectrum.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6433/7095,Social choice; Price of anarchy
28,2013,Main Technical Papers,Improving WalkSAT for Random k-Satisfiability Problem with k > 3,"Shaowei Cai, Kaile Su, Chuan Luo","Stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms are well known for their ability to efficiently find models of random instances of the Boolean satisfiablity (SAT) problem. One of the most famous SLS algorithms for SAT is WalkSAT, which is an initial algorithm that has wide influence among modern SLS algorithms. Recently, there has been increasing interest in WalkSAT, due to the discovery of its great power on large random 3-SAT instances. However, the performance of WalkSAT on random $k$-SAT instances with $k>3$ lags far behind. Indeed, there have been few works in improving SLS algorithms for such instances. This work takes a large step towards this direction. We propose a novel concept namely $multilevel$ $make$. Based on this concept, we design a scoring function called $linear$ $make$, which is utilized to break ties in WalkSAT, leading to a new algorithm called WalkSAT$lm$. Our experimental results on random 5-SAT and 7-SAT instances show that WalkSAT$lm$ improves WalkSAT by orders of magnitudes. Moreover, WalkSAT$lm$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers on random 5-SAT instances, while competes well on random 7-SAT ones. Additionally, WalkSAT$lm$ performs very well on random instances from SAT Challenge 2012, indicating its robustness.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6145/7097,"Local Search, Satisfiability, Muti-level make"
29,2013,Main Technical Papers,A Kernel Density Estimate-Based Approach to Component Goodness Modeling,"Nuno Cardoso, Rui Abreu","Intermittent fault localization approaches account for the fact that faulty components may fail intermittently by considering a parameter (known as goodness) that quantifies the probability that faulty components may still exhibit correct behavior. Current, state-of-the-art approaches (1) assume that this goodness probability is context independent and (2) do not provide means for integrating past diagnosis experience in the diagnostic mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel approach, coined Non-linear Feedback-based Goodness Estimate (NFGE), that uses kernel density estimations (KDE) to address such limitations. We evaluated the approach with both synthetic and real data, yielding lower estimation errors, thus increasing the diagnosis performance.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6192/7098,Intermittent Fault Localization; Kernel Density Estimation; Bayesian Reasoning
30,2013,Main Technical Papers,Instructor Rating Markets,"Mithun Chakraborty, Sanmay Das, Allen Lavoie, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Yonatan Naamad","We describe the design of Instructor Rating Markets (IRMs) where human participants interact through intelligent automated market-makers in order to provide dynamic collective feedback to instructors on the progress of their classes. The markets are among the first to enable the empirical study of prediction markets where traders can affect the very outcomes they are trading on. More than 200 students across the Rensselaer campus participated in markets for ten classes in the Fall 2010 semester. In this paper, we describe how we designed these markets in order to elicit useful information, and analyze data from the deployment. We show that market prices convey useful information on future instructor ratings and contain significantly more information than do past ratings. The bulk of useful information contained in the price of a particular class is provided by students who are in that class, showing that the markets are serving to disseminate insider information. At the same time, we find little evidence of attempted manipulation by raters. The markets are also a laboratory for comparing different market designs and the resulting price dynamics, and we show how they can be used to compare market making algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6415/7099,prediction markets; market making

In this paper, uncorrelated Lasso is proposed for variable selection, where variable de-correlation is considered simultaneously with variable selection, so that selected variables are uncorrelated as much as possible.

32,2013,Main Technical Papers,Goal-Oriented Euclidean Heuristics with Manifold Learning,"Wenlin Chen, Yixin Chen, Kilian Weinberger, Qiang Lu, Xiaoping Chen","Recently, a Euclidean heuristic (EH) has been proposed for A* search. EH exploits manifold learning methods to construct an embedding of the state space graph, and derives an admissible heuristic distance between two states from the Euclidean distance between their respective embedded points. EH has shown good performance and memory efficiency in comparison to other existing heuristics such as differential heuristics. However, its potential has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a number of techniques that can significantly improve the quality of EH. We propose a goal-oriented manifold learning scheme that optimizes the Euclidean distance to goals in the embedding while maintaining admissibility and consistency. We also propose a state heuristic enhancement technique to reduce the gap between heuristic and true distances. The enhanced heuristic is admissible but no longer consistent. We then employ a modified search algorithm, known as B' algorithm, that achieves optimality with inconsistent heuristics using consistency check and propagation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the above techniques and report un-matched reduction in search costs across several non-trivial benchmark search problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6342/7104,Heuristic search; Manifold learning; Euclidean heuristic
33,2013,Main Technical Papers,From Interest to Function: Location Estimation in Social Media,"Yan Chen, Jichang Zhao, Xia Hu, Xiaoming Zhang, Zhoujun Li, Tat-Seng Chua","Recent years have witnessed the tremendous development of social media, which attracts a vast number of Internet users. The high-dimension content generated by these users provides an unique opportunity to understand their behavior deeply. As one of the most fundamental topics, location estimation attracts more and more research efforts. Different from the previous literature, we find that user's location is strongly related to user interest. Based on this, we first build a detection model to mine user interest from short text. We then establish the mapping between location function and user interest before presenting an efficient framework to predict the user's location with convincing fidelity. Thorough evaluations and comparisons on an authentic data set show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts approaches.

34,2013,Main Technical Papers,Dynamic Minimization of Sentential Decision Diagrams,"Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche","The Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) is a recently proposed representation of Boolean functions, containing Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) as a distinguished subclass. While OBDDs are characterized by total variable orders, SDDs are characterized more generally by vtrees. As both OBDDs and SDDs have canonical representations, searching for OBDDs and SDDs of minimal size simplifies to searching for variable orders and vtrees, respectively. For OBDDs, there are effective heuristics for dynamic reordering, based on locally swapping variables. In this paper, we propose an analogous approach for SDDs which navigates the space of vtrees via two operations: one based on tree rotations and a second based on swapping children in a vtree. We propose a particular heuristic for dynamically searching the space of vtrees, showing that it can find SDDs that are an order-of-magnitude more succinct than OBDDs found by dynamic reordering.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6470/7108,knowledge compilation; decision diagrams

Updating parameters frequently can prove to be computationally or monetarily expensive. In this paper, we introduce an efficient primal-dual based online algorithm that performs lazy updates to the parameter vector and show that its performance is competitive with reasonable strategies which have the benefit of hindsight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in the online portfolio selection domain where a trader has to pay proportional transaction costs every time his portfolio is updated.

37,2013,Main Technical Papers,Assumption-Based Planning: Generating Plans and Explanations under Incomplete Knowledge,"Sammy Davis-Mendelow, Jorge A. Baier, Sheila McIlraith","Many practical planning problems necessitate the generation of a plan under incomplete information about the state of the world. In this paper we propose the notion of Assumption-Based Planning. Unlike conformant planning, which attempts to find a plan under all possible completions of the initial state, an assumption-based plan supports the assertion of additional assumptions about the state of the world, often resulting in high quality plans where no conformant plan exists. We are interested in this paradigm of planning for two reasons: 1) it captures a compelling form of \emph{commonsense planning}, and 2) it is of great utility in the generation of explanations, diagnoses, and counter-examples -- tasks which share a computational core with We formalize the notion of assumption-based planning, establishing a relationship between assumption-based and conformant planning, and prove properties of such plans. We further provide for the scenario where some assumptions are more preferred than others. Exploiting the correspondence with conformant planning, we propose a means of computing assumption-based plans via a translation to classical planning. Our translation is an extension of the popular approach proposed by Palacios and Geffner and realized in their T0 planner. We have implemented our planner, A0, as a variant of T0 and tested it on a number of expository domains drawn from the International Planning Competition. Our results illustrate the utility of this new planning paradigm.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6466/7115,"Conformant Planning, Assumptions, Diagnosis, Verification"

They provide a very general modeling framework by allowing the combination of numeric and qualitative assessments over a discrete domain, and can be compactly encoded by exploiting the same factorization of joint probability distributions that are behind the Bayesian networks.  This paper explores the computational complexity of semi-qualitative probabilistic networks, and takes the polytree-shaped networks as its main target. We show that the inference problem is coNP-Complete for binary polytrees with multiple observed nodes. We also show that inferences can be performed in time linear in the number of nodes if there is a single observed node. Because our proof is constructive, we obtain an efficient linear time algorithm for SQPNs under such assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exact polynomial-time algorithm for SQPNs.

Researchers have been investing significant efforts to develop heuristics or restrictions to make planning practically feasible. Case-based planning is a heuristic approach where one tries to reuse previous experience when solving similar problems in order to avoid some of the planning effort. Plan reuse may offer an interesting  alternative to plan generation in some settings.  We provide theoretical results that identify situations in which plan reuse is provably tractable. We perform our analysis in the framework of parameterized complexity, which supports a rigorous worst-case complexity analysis that takes structural properties of the input into account in terms of parameters. A central notion of parameterized complexity is fixed-parameter tractability which extends the classical notion of polynomial-time tractability by utilizing the effect of parameters.  We draw a detailed map of the parameterized complexity landscape of several variants of problems that arise in the context of case-based planning. In particular, we consider the problem of reusing an existing plan, imposing various restrictions in terms of parameters, such as the number of steps that can be added to the existing plan to turn it into a solution of the planning instance at hand.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6411/7120,planning; plan reuse; case-based planning; fixed-parameter tractability; parameterized complexity

In this setting, pulling an arm will receive a random reward together with a random cost, and the objective of an algorithm is to pull a sequence of arms in order to maximize the expected total reward with the costs of pulling those arms complying with a budget constraint. This new setting models many Internet applications (e.g., ad exchange, sponsored search, and cloud computing) in a more accurate manner than previous settings where the pulling of arms is either costless or with a fixed cost. We propose two UCB based algorithms for the new setting. The first algorithm needs prior knowledge about the lower bound of the expected costs when computing the exploration term. The second algorithm eliminates this need by estimating the minimal expected costs from empirical observations, and therefore can be applied to more real-world applications where prior knowledge is not available. We prove that both algorithms have nice learning abilities, with regret bounds of O(ln B). Furthermore, we show that when applying our proposed algorithms to a previous setting with fixed costs (which can be regarded as our special case), one can improve the previously obtained regret bound. Our simulation results on real-time bidding in ad exchange verify the effectiveness of the algorithms and are consistent with our theoretical analysis.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6381/7122,multi-armed bandit; online learning; budget constraint; variable costs

Inspired by the recent  successes of search-based structured prediction, we introduce a new  framework for structured prediction called {\em HC-Search}. Given a  structured input, the framework uses a search procedure guided by a  learned heuristic H to uncover high quality candidate outputs and then  uses a separate learned cost function C to select a final prediction  among those outputs. We can decompose the regret of the overall approach  into the loss due to H not leading to high quality outputs, and the  loss due to C not selecting the best among the generated outputs. Guided  by this decomposition, we minimize the overall regret in a greedy  stage-wise manner by first training H to quickly uncover high quality  outputs via imitation learning, and then training C to correctly rank  the outputs generated via H according to their true losses.

As naive value invention leads to programs with infinite grounding and answer sets, syntactic safety criteria are imposed on programs. However, traditional criteria are in many cases unnecessarily strong and limit expressiveness. We present liberal domain-expansion (de-) safe programs, a novel generic class of answer set programs with external source access that has a finite grounding and allows for value invention. De-safe programs use so-called term bounding functions as a parameter for modular instantiation with concrete—e.g., syntactic or semantic or both—safety criteria. This ensures extensibility of the approach in the future. We provide concrete instances of the framework and develop an operator that can be used for computing a finite grounding.

Pathfinding for multiple agents also aims to plan such routes for each agent, subject to different constraints, such as restrictions on the length of each path or on the total length of paths, no self-intersecting paths, no intersection of paths/plans, no crossing/meeting each other. It also has variations for finding optimal solutions, e.g., with respect to the maximum path length, or the sum of plan lengths. These problems are important for many real-life applications, such as motion planning, vehicle routing, environmental monitoring, patrolling, computer games. Motivated by such applications, we introduce a formal framework that is general enough to address all these problems: we use the expressive high-level representation formalism and efficient solvers of the declarative programming paradigm Answer Set Programming.

It becomes more perplexing in multi-agent settings, since the action of an agent may be partially observable to other agents. In this paper, we present a general approach to reasoning about actions and belief change in multi-agent settings. Our approach is based on a multi-agent extension to the situation calculus, augmented by a plausibility relation over situations and another one over actions, which is used to represent agents' different perspectives on actions. When an action is performed, we update the agents' plausibility order on situations by giving priority to the plausibility order on actions, in line with the AGM approach of giving priority to new information. We show that our notion of belief satisfies KD45 properties.

52,2013,Main Technical Papers,Backdoors to Normality for Disjunctive Logic Programs,"Johannes Klaus Fichte, Stefan Szeider","Over the last two decades, propositional satisfiability (SAT) has become one of the most successful and widely applied techniques for the solution of NP-complete problems. The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how SAT can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in propositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), BRAVE REASONING and SKEPTICA REASONING, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP or co-NP. One cannot transform these two reasoning problems into SAT in polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.  We show that certain structural aspects of disjunctive logic programs can be utilized to break through this complexity barrier, using new techniques from Parameterized Complexity. In particular, we exhibit transformations from BRAVE and SKEPTICAL REASONING to SAT that run in time $O(2^k n^2)$ where k is a structural parameter of the instance and n the input size. In other words, the reduction is fixed-parameter tractable for parameter k. As the parameter k we take the size of a smallest backdoor with respect to the class of normal (i.e., disjunction-free) programs. Such a backdoor is a set of atoms that when deleted makes the program normal. In consequence, the combinatorial explosion, which is expected when transforming a problem from the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy to the first level, can now be confined to the parameter k, while the running time of the reduction is polynomial in the input size n, where the order of the polynomial is independent of k. We show that such a transformation is not possible if we consider backdoors with respect to tightness instead of normality.  We think that our approach is applicable to many other hard combinatorial problems that lie beyond NP or co-NP, and thus significantly enlarge the applicability of SAT.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6360/7147,answer-set programming; backdoors; complexity barrier breaking reduction; nonmonotonic reasoning; parameterized complexity; propositional satisfiability

A strategy profile is an SNE if no coalition of agents can benefit by deviating.   We present the first general-purpose algorithms for SNE finding in games with more than two agents. An SNE must simultaneously be a Nash equilibrium (NE) and the optimal solution of multiple non-convex optimization problems. This makes even the derivation of necessary and sufficient mathematical equilibrium constraints difficult. We show that forcing an SNE to be resilient only to pure-strategy deviations by coalitions, unlike for NEs, is only a necessary condition here.  Second, we show that the application of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions leads to another set of necessary conditions that are not sufficient.  Third, we show that forcing the Pareto efficiency of an SNE for each coalition with respect to coalition correlated strategies is sufficient but not necessary.  We then develop a tree search algorithm for SNE finding.  At each node, it calls an oracle to suggest a candidate SNE and then verifies the candidate.  We show that our new necessary conditions can be leveraged to make the oracle more powerful.

57,2013,Main Technical Papers,Vesselness Features and the Inverse Compositional AAM for Robust Face Recognition Using Thermal IR,"Reza Shija Ghiass, Ognjen Arandjelovic, Hakim Bendada, Xavier Maldague","Over the course of the last decade, infrared (IR) and particularly thermal IR imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when applied in the real world. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum illumination changes, IR images introduce specific challenges of their own, most notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for fitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which addresses these major challenges. Specifically, to normalize for pose and facial expression changes we generate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial expression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial expression. This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active appearance model (AAM) fitting. This is the first publication which explores the use of an AAM on thermal IR images; we propose a pre-processing step which enhances detail in thermal images, making AAM convergence faster and more accurate. To overcome the problem of thermal IR image sensitivity to the exact pattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on reliable anatomical features. In contrast to previous approaches, our representation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability of the extracted features. This makes the proposed representation much more robust both to pose and scale changes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the largest public database of thermal IR images of faces on which it achieved 100% identification rate, significantly outperforming previously described methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6364/7157,

Radial restraint is parameterized by a norm that measures the syntactic complexity of a term, along with an abstraction function based on that norm.  When a term exceeds a bound for the norm, the term is assigned the WFS's third truth-value of undefined.  If the norm is finitary, radial restraint guarantees finiteness of models and decidability of inferencing, even when logical functions are present.  It further guarantees soundness, even when non-monotonicity is present.  We give a fixed-point semantics for radially  restrained well-founded models which soundly approximate well-founded models.  We also show how to perform correct inferencing relative to such models, via SLG_ABS, an extension of tabled SLG resolution that uses norm-based abstraction functions.  Finally we discuss how SLG_ABS is implemented in the engine of XSB Prolog, and scales to knowledge bases with more than 10^8 rules and facts.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6459/7164,"knowledge representation, declarative logic programs, termination, decidability, finiteness, bounded rationality, model theory, proof theory"

In this paper, we propose a novel convex subspace representation learning method for unsupervised multi-view clustering. We ﬁrst formulate the subspace learning with multiple views as a joint optimization problem with a common subspace representation matrix and a group sparsity inducing norm. By exploiting the properties of dual norms, we then show a convex min-max dual formulation with a sparsity inducing trace norm can be obtained. We develop a proximal bundle optimization algorithm to globally solve the min-max optimization problem. Our empirical study shows the proposed subspace representation learning method can effectively facilitate multi-view clustering and induce superior clustering results than alternative multi-view clustering methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6185/7166,Multi-view Learning; Convex Optimization; Subspace Representation Learning
62,2013,Main Technical Papers,Reduce and Re-Lift: Bootstrapped Lifted Likelihood Maximization for MAP,"Fabian Hadiji, Kristian Kersting","By handling whole sets of indistinguishable objects together, lifted belief propagation approaches have rendered large, previously intractable, probabilistic inference problems quickly solvable. In this paper, we show that Kumar and Zilberstein's likelihood maximization (LM) approach to MAP inference is liftable, too, and actually provides additional structure for optimization. Specifically, it has been recognized that some pseudo marginals may converge quickly, turning intuitively into pseudo evidence. This additional evidence typically changes the structure of the lifted network: it may expand or reduce it. The current lifted network, however, can be viewed as an upper bound on the size of the lifted network required to finish likelihood maximization. Consequently, we re-lift the network only if the pseudo evidence yields a reduced network, which can efficiently be computed on the current lifted network. Our experimental results on Ising models, image segmentation and relational entity resolution demonstrate that this bootstrapped LM via ""reduce and re-lift"" finds MAP assignments comparable to those found by the original LM approach, but in a fraction of the time.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6397/7168,"MAP inference, Likelihood Maximization, Lifted Inference"
63,2013,Main Technical Papers,"Search More, Disclose Less","Chen Hajaj, Noam Hazon, David Sarne, Avshalom Elmalech","The blooming of comparison shopping agents (CSAs) in recent years enables buyers in today's markets to query more than a single CSA while shopping, thus substantially expanding the list of sellers whose prices they obtain. From the individual CSA point of view, however, the multi-CSAs querying is definitely non-favorable as most of today's CSAs benefit depends on payments they receive from sellers upon transferring buyers to their websites (and making a purchase).  The most straightforward way for the CSA to improve its competence is through spending more resources on getting more sellers' prices, potentially resulting in a more attractive ``best price''.  In this paper we suggest a complementary approach that improves the attractiveness of the best price returned to the buyer without having to extend the CSAs' price database. This approach, which we term ``selective price disclosure'' relies on removing some of the prices known to the CSA from the list of results returned to the buyer. The advantage of this approach is in the ability to affect the buyer's beliefs regarding the probability of obtaining more attractive prices if querying additional CSAs. The paper presents two methods for choosing the subset of prices to be presented to a fully-rational buyer, attempting to overcome the computational complexity associated with evaluating all possible subsets. The effectiveness and efficiency of the methods are demonstrated using real data, collected from five CSAs for four products. Furthermore, since people are known to have an inherently bounded rationality, the two methods are also evaluated with human buyers, demonstrating that selective price-disclosing can be highly effective with people, however the subset of prices that needs to be used should be extracted in a different (and more simplistic) manner.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6327/7170,"comparison shopping agents, information disclosure, experimentation"

It is well known that MSA can be formulated as a shortest path problem and solved using heuristic search, but the memory requirement of A* makes it impractical for all but the smallest problems.  Partial Expansion A* (PEA*) reduces the space complexity of A* by generating only the most promising successor nodes.  However, even PEA* exhausts available memory on many problems.  Another alternative is Iterative Deepening Dynamic Programming, which uses an uninformed search order but stores only the nodes along the search frontier.  However, it too cannot scale to the largest problems.  In this paper, we propose storing nodes on cheap and plentiful secondary storage.  We present a new general-purpose algorithm, Parallel External PEA* (\xppea), that combines PEA* with Delayed Duplicate Detection to take advantage of external memory and multiple processors to solve large MSA problems.  In our experiments, \xppea\ is the first algorithm capable of solving the entire Reference Set 1 of the standard BAliBASE benchmark using a biologically accurate cost function.

Such an ad-hoc process is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel robust discrete matrix completion algorithm that produces the prediction from the collection of user specified discrete values by introducing a new discrete constraint to the matrix completion model. Our method achieves a high prediction accuracy, very close to the most optimal value of competitive methods with threshold values tuning. We solve the difficult integer programming problem via incorporating augmented Lagrangian method in an elegant way, which greatly accelerates the converge process of our method and provides the asymptotic convergence in theory.

This category of approaches often resort to other clustering methods, such as K-Means, to get the final cluster. The potential flaw of such common practice is that the obtained relaxed continuous spectral solution could severely deviate from the true discrete solution. In this paper, we propose to impose an additional orthonormal constraint to better approximate the optimal continuous solution to the graph cut objective functions. Such a method, called spectral rotation in literature, optimizes the spectral clustering objective functions better than K-Means, and improves the clustering accuracy. We would provide efficient algorithm to solve the new problem rigorously, which is not significantly more costly than K-Means. We also establish the connection between our method andK-Means to provide theoretical motivation of our method.

The proposed model assumes that there are an infinite number of latent vectors that are shared by all domains, and that each object is generated using one of the latent vectors and a domain-specific linear projection. By inferring a latent vector to be used for generating each object, objects in different domains are clustered in shared groups, and thus we can find matching between clusters in an unsupervised manner.

With more agents, computing the subgame perfect Nash equilibria is more difficult. There can be an exponential number of equilibria and computing even one of them is PSPACE-hard.

With a more careful approach, this trivial upper bound can be improved for certain natural restrictions of the CSP. In this paper we establish theoretical limits to such improvements, and draw a detailed landscape of the subexponential-time complexity of CSP. We first establish relations between the subexponential-time complexity of CSP and that of other problems, including CNF-Sat. We exploit this connection to provide tight characterizations of the subexponential-time complexity of CSP under common assumptions in complexity theory. For several natural CSP parameters, we obtain threshold functions that precisely dictate the subexponential-time complexity of CSP with respect to the parameters under consideration.

This result is not widely exploited in practicebecause enforcing higher-level consistencies can be costlyand can change the structure of the constraint network andincrease its width. Recently, R(*,m)C was proposed as a relational consistency property that does not modify the structureof the graph and, thus, does not affect its width. In this paper,we explore two main strategies, based on a tree decomposition of the CSP, for improving the performance of enforcingR(*,m)C and getting closer to the above tractability condition. Those strategies are: a) localizing the application ofthe consistency algorithm to the clusters of the tree decomposition, and b) bolstering constraint propagation betweenclusters by adding redundant constraints at their separators,for which we propose three new schemes.

The lack of exact semantics for user-defined operators interferes with the query optimization process, thus putting the burden of suggesting, at least partial, query plans on the user. In an attempt to ease this burden, we propose a formal model that allows for data-parallel program synthesis (DPPS) in a semantically well-defined manner.

This experience contradicts the apparentparallelizability of exploring a combinatorial search space. Wepresent evidence that this discrepancy can be explained by studyingSAT solvers through a proof complexity lens, as resolution refutationengines. Starting with theobservation that a recently studied measure of resolution proofs,namely depth, provides a (weak) upper bound to the best possiblespeedup achievable by such solvers, we empirically show the existenceof bottlenecks to parallelizability that resolution proofs typicallygenerated by SAT solvers exhibit. Further, we propose a new measureof parallelizability based on the best-case makespan of an offlineresource constrained scheduling problem. This measureexplicitly accounts for a bounded number of parallel processors andappears to empirically correlate with parallel speedups observed inpractice.

Provided the red variables are chosen so that red-black plan generation is tractable, one can generate such a plan for every search state, and take its length as the heuristic distance estimate. Previous results were not suitable for this purpose because they identified tractable fragments for red-black plan existence, as opposed to red-black plan generation. We identify a new fragment of red-black planning, that fixes this issue. We devise machinery to efficiently generate red-black plans, and to automatically select the red variables.

Solving a POMDP is an intractable problem and even the state of the art POMDP solvers are too computationally expensive for large domains. This is a major bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic, called the pairwise heuristic, that can be used in a one-step greedy strategy to find a near optimal solution for POMDP problems very quickly. This approach is a good candidate for large problems where real-time solution is a necessity but exact optimality of the solution is not vital. The pairwise heuristic uses the optimal solutions for pairs of states. For each pair of states in the POMDP, we find the optimal sequence of actions to resolve the uncertainty and to maximize the reward, given that the agent is uncertain about which state of the pair it is in. Then we use these sequences as a heuristic and find the optimal action in each step of the greedy strategy using this heuristic. We have tested our method on the available large classical test benchmarks in various domains. The resulting total reward is close to, if not greater than, the total reward obtained by other state of the art POMDP solvers, while the time required to find the solution is always much less.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6441/7199,"Decision Making, Planning under Uncertainty"

These measures are known to be better suited to data manifold with nonconvex-shaped clusters, compared to Euclidean distance, so that k-nearest neighbor (NN) search is improved in such metric spaces. In this paper we present a new link-based dissimilarity measure based on minimax paths between nodes. Two main benefits of minimax path-based dissimilarity measure are: (1) only a subset of paths is considered to make it scalable, while Euclidean commute time distance considers all possible paths; (2) it better captures nonconvex-shaped cluster structure, compared to shortest path distance. We define the total cost assigned to a path between nodes as Lp norm of intermediate costs of edges involving the path, showing that minimax path emerges from our Lp norm over paths framework. We also define minimax distance as the intermediate cost of the longest edge on the minimax path, then present a greedy algorithm to compute k smallest minimax distances between a query and N data points in O(log N + k log k) time.

However, there is little work available to do this effectively. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical aspect sentiment model (HASM) to discover a hierarchical structure of aspect-based sentiments from unlabeled online reviews. In HASM, the whole structure is a tree. Each node itself is a two-level tree, whose root represents an aspect and the children represent the sentiment polarities associated with it. Each aspect or sentiment polarity is modeled as a distribution of words. To automatically extract both the structure and parameters of the tree, we use a Bayesian nonparametric model, recursive Chinese Restaurant Process (rCRP), as the prior and jointly infer the aspect-sentiment tree from the review texts.

Numerousspecialized filtering algorithms, enforcing the wellknown property called generalized arc consistency (GAC),have been developed for such constraints. Among the most successful GAC algorithms for table constraints, we find variants of simple tabular reduction (STR), like STR2. In this paper,we propose an extension of STR-based algorithms that achieves full pairwise consistency (FPWC), a consistency stronger than GAC and max restricted pairwise consistency (maxRPWC). Our approach involves counting the number of occurrences of specific combinations of values in constraint intersections.

89,2013,Main Technical Papers,Solving Security Games on Graphs via Marginal Probabilities,"Joshua Letchford, Vincent Conitzer","Security games involving the allocation of multiple security resources to defend multiple targets generally have an exponential number of pure  strategies for the defender.  One method that has been successful in  addressing this computational issue is to instead directly compute the marginal probabilities with which the individual resources are assigned  (first pursued by Kiekintveld et al. (2009)).  However, in sufficiently general settings, there exist games where these marginal solutions are not implementable, that is, they do not correspond to any mixed strategy  of the defender.  In this paper, we examine security games where the defender tries to  monitor the vertices of a graph, and we show how the type  of graph, the type of schedules, and the type of defender resources  affect the applicability of this approach.  In some settings, we show the  approach is applicable and give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing  an optimal defender strategy; in other settings, we give counterexample games that demonstrate that the approach does not work, and prove NP-hardness results for computing an optimal defender strategy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6467/7211,Game Theory; Stackelberg game

Story generation is knowledge-intensive; traditional story generators rely on a priori defined domain models about fictional worlds, including characters, places, and actions that can be performed. Manually authoring the domain models is costly and thus not scalable. We present a novel class of story generation system that can generate stories in an unknown domain. Our system (a) automatically learns a domain model by crowdsourcing a corpus of narrative examples and (b) generates stories by sampling from the space defined by the domain model. A large-scale evaluation shows that stories generated by our system for a previously unknown topic are comparable in quality to simple stories authored by untrained humans",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6399/7212,Story Generation; Crowdsourcing

While synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) augmented with lambda calculus (lambda-SCFG) provides an effective mechanism for semantic parsing, how to learn such lambda-SCFG rules still remains a challenge because of the difficulty in determining the correspondence between NL sentences and logical forms. To alleviate this structural divergence problem, we extend the GHKM algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art algorithm for learning synchronous grammars in statistical machine translation, to induce lambda-SCFG from pairs of NL sentences and logical forms. By treating logical forms as trees, we reformulate the theory behind GHKM that gives formal semantics to the alignment between NL words and logical form tokens. Experiments on the GEOQUERY dataset show that our semantic parser achieves an F-measure of 90.2%, the best result published to date.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6189/7214,semantic parsing; GHKM algorithm; synchronous context-free grammar; lambda calculus; rule extraction

However, most of the state-of-the-art HC algorithms suffer from high computational costs. To improve the performance of solving, we propose a stochastic perceptron (SP) algorithm in the large margin framework. In particular, a stochastic choice procedure is devised to decide the direction of next iteration. We prove that after finite iterations the SP algorithm yields a sub-optimal solution with high probability if the input instances are separable. For large-scale and high-dimensional data sets, we reform SP to the kernel version (KSP), which dramatically reduces the memory space needed. The KSP algorithm has the merit of low space complexity as well as low time complexity. The experimental results show that our KSP approach achieves almost the same accuracy as the contemporary algorithms on the real-world data sets, but with much less CPU running time.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6326/7219,"Large Margin, Hierarchical Classification, Stochastic Perceptron"

There are two challenging issues for mixed-type datasets, namely modeling mutual correlations between mixed-type attributes and capturing large variations due to anomalies. This paper presents BuffDetect, a robust error buffering approach for anomaly detection in mixed-type datasets. A new variant of the generalized linear model is proposed to model the dependency between mixed-type attributes. The model incorporates an error buffering component based on Student-t distribution to absorb the variations caused by anomalies. However, because of the non- Gaussian design, the problem becomes analytically intractable. We propose a novel Bayesian inference approach, which integrates Laplace approximation and several computational optimizations, and is able to efficiently approximate the posterior of high dimensional latent variables by iteratively updating the latent variables in groups.

Pairwise constraint propagation has been studied extensively, where each pairwise constraint is defined over a pair of data points from a single view. In contrast, very little attention has been paid to inter-view constraint propagation, which is more challenging since each pairwise constraint is now defined over a pair of data points from different views. Although both intra-view and inter-view constraint propagation are crucial for multi-view tasks, most previous methods can not handle them simultaneously. To address this challenging issue, we propose to decompose these two types of constraint propagation into semi-supervised learning subproblems so that they can be uniformly solved based on the traditional label propagation techniques. To further integrate them into a unified framework, we utilize the results of intra-view constraint propagation to adjust the similarity matrix of each view and then perform inter-view constraint propagation with the adjusted similarity matrices.

Currently available tools tend to use either labels or features for classification, but both are necessary to describe the image properly. There have been recent successes in using vector-valued functions, which construct matrix-valued kernels, to explore the multi-label structure in the output space. This has motivated us to develop multi-view vector-valued manifold regularization (MV$^3$MR) in order to integrate multiple features. MV$^3$MR exploits the complementary properties of different features, and discovers the intrinsic local geometry of the compact support shared by different features, under the theme of manifold regularization.

Unlike traditional temporal-difference (TD) methods for RL, mirror descent based RL methods undertake proximal gradient updates of weights in a dual space, which is linked together with the primal  space using a Legendre transform involving the gradient of a strongly convex function. Mirror descent RL can be viewed as a proximal TD algorithm using Bregman divergence as the distance generating function.

While agents have their initial inclination, they may interact and influence each other, and therefore modify their preferences, until hopefully they reach a stable state and declare their final inclination. At that point, a voting rule is used to aggregate the agents’ preferences and generate the collective decision. Recent work has modeled the influence phenomenon in the case of voting over a single issue. Here we generalize this model to account for preferences over combinatorially structured domains including several issues. We propose a way to model influence when agents express their preferences as CP-nets. We define two procedures for aggregating preferences in this scenario, by interleaving voting and influence convergence, and study their resistance to bribery.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6383/7233,"influence, bribery, preferences, CP-nets"

We analyze this problem from the viewpoint of the vendors, asking under what conditions a vendor should adopt a volume-based price schedule rather than posting a fixed price, either as a monopolist or when competing with other vendors. When vendors have uncertainty about buyers' valuations specified by a known distribution, we show that a vendor is always better off posting a fixed price, provided that buyers' types are i.i.d. and that other vendors also use fixed prices. We also show that these assumptions cannot be relaxed: if buyers are not i.i.d., or other vendors post discount schedules, then posting a schedule may yield higher profit for the vendor. We provide similar results under a distribution-free uncertainty model, where vendors minimize their maximum regret over all type realizations.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6386/7237,discount schedules; competition; fixed prices

The L1-norm low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) has been a popular approach to solving this problem. However, L1-norm LRMF is difficult to achieve due to its non-convexity and non-smoothness, and existing methods are often inefficient and fail to converge to a desired solution. In this paper we propose a novel cyclic weighted median (CWM) method, which is intrinsically a coordinate decent algorithm, for L1-norm LRMF. The CWM method minimizes the objective by solving a sequence of scalar minimization sub-problems, each of which is convex and can be easily solved by the weighted median filter.

Most existing rank aggregation methods blindly combine multiple rank lists with possibly considerable noises, which often degrades their performances. In this paper, we propose a new model for robust rank aggregation (RRA) via matrix learning, which recovers a latent rank list from the possibly incomplete and noisy input rank lists. In our model, we construct a pairwise comparison matrix to encode the order information in each input rank list. Based on our observations, each comparison matrix can be naturally decomposed into a shared low-rank matrix, combined with a deviation error matrix which is the sum of a column-sparse matrix and a row-sparse one. The latent rank list can be easily extracted from the learned low-rank matrix. The optimization formulation of RRA has an element-wise multiplication operator to handle missing values, a symmetric constraint on the noise structure, and a factorization trick to restrict the maximum rank of the low-rank matrix. To solve this challenging optimization problem, we propose a novel procedure based on the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier scheme. We conduct extensive experiments on meta-search and collaborative filtering benchmark datasets.

This paper presents a  novel agent design for repeated negotiation in incomplete  information settings that learns to reveal information strategically  during the negotiation process. The agent used classical machine  learning techniques to predict how people make and respond to offers  during the negotiation, how they reveal information and their  response to potential revelation actions by the agent. The agent was  evaluated empirically in an extensive empirical study spanning  hundreds of human subjects. Results show that the agent was able to  outperform people.

118,2013,Main Technical Papers,Salient Object Detection via Low-Rank and Structured Sparse Matrix Decomposition,"Houwen Peng, Bing Li, Rongrong Ji, Weiming Hu, Weihua Xiong, Congyan Lang","Salient object detection provides an alternative solution to various image semantic understanding tasks such as object recognition, adaptive compression and image retrieval. Recently, low-rank matrix recovery (LR) theory has been introduced into saliency detection, and achieves impressed results. However, the existing LR-based models neglect the underlying structure of images, and inevitably degrade the associated performance. In this paper, we propose a Low-rank and Structured sparse Matrix Decomposition (LSMD) model for salient object detection. In the model, a tree-structured sparsity-inducing norm regularization is firstly introduced to provide a hierarchical description of the image structure to ensure the completeness of the extracted salient object. The similarity of saliency values within the salient object is then guaranteed by the $\ell _\infty$-norm. Finally, high-level priors are integrated to guide the matrix decomposition and enhance the saliency detection. Experimental results on the largest public benchmark database show that our model outperforms existing LR-based approaches and other state-of-the-art methods, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the structure cues in our model.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6290/7270,Saliency Detection; Low Rank; Structured Sparsity; Matrix Decomposition

Agents express their preferences over the decisions via soft constraints. We consider both sequential preference aggregation methods (they aggregate the preferences over one variable at a time) and one-step methods and we study the computational complexity of influencing them through bribery.

120,2013,Main Technical Papers,Progression of Decomposed Situation Calculus Theories,"Denis Ponomaryov, Mikhail Soutchanski","In many tasks related to reasoning about consequences of a logical theory, it is desirable to decompose the theory into a number of components with weakly-related or independent signatures. This facilitates reasoning when signature of a query formula belongs to only one of the components. However, an initial theory may be subject to change due to execution of actions affecting features mentioned in the theory. Having once computed a decomposition of a theory, one would like to know whether a decomposition has to be computed again for the theory obtained from taking into account the changes resulting from execution of an action. In the paper, we address this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where change of an initial theory is related to the well-studied notion of progression. Progression provides a form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those features which are subject to change and computing new values for them. We prove new results about properties of decomposition components under forgetting and show when a decomposition can be preserved in progression of an initial theory.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6333/7272,"decomposition, inseparability, forgetting, progression, basic action theory, the projection problem, situation calculus"

In the Boolean domain, these are referred to as Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUSes). In some settings, one needs to enumerate MUSes of a Boolean formula. Most often the goal is to enumerate all MUSes. In cases where this is computationally infeasible, an alternative is to enumerate some MUSes. This paper develops a novel approach for partial enumeration of MUSes, that complements existing alternatives. If the enumeration of all MUSes is viable, then existing alternatives represent the best option. However, for formulas where the enumeration of all MUSes is unrealistic, our approach provides a solution for enumerating some MUSes within a given time bound. The experimental results focus on formulas for which existing solutions are unable to enumerate MUSes, and shows that the new approach can in most cases enumerate a non-negligible number of MUSes within a given time bound.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6413/7273,Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets; Minimal Conflict Sets; MUS Enumeration
122,2013,Main Technical Papers,Multiagent Learning with a Noisy Global Reward Signal,"Scott Proper, Kagan Tumer","Scaling multiagent reinforcement learning to domains with many agents is a complex problem. In particular, multiagent credit assignment becomes a key issue as the system size increases. Some multiagent systems suffer from a global reward signal that is very noisy or difficult to analyze. This makes deriving a learnable local reward signal very difficult. Difference rewards (a particular instance of reward shaping) have been used to alleviate this concern, but they remain difficult to compute in many domains. In this paper we present an approach to modeling the global reward using function approximation that allows the quick computation of local rewards. We demonstrate how this model can result in significant improvements in behavior for three congestion problems: a multiagent ``bar problem'', a complex simulation of the United States airspace, and a generic air traffic domain. We show how the model of the global reward may be either learned on- or off-line using either linear functions or neural networks. For the bar problem, we show an increase in reward of nearly 200% over learning using the global reward directly. For the air traffic problem, we show a decrease in costs of 25% over learning using the global reward directly.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6263/7274,Multiagent Learning; Congestion Problems; Difference Rewards

The robust Bayesian truth serum (RBTS) for small populations and binary signals is particularly interesting since it does not require a common prior to be known to the mechanism. We further analyze the problem of the common prior not known to the mechanism and give several results regarding the restrictions that need to be placed in order to have an incentive-compatible mechanism. Moreover, we construct a Bayes-Nash incentive-compatible scheme called multi-valued RBTS that generalizes RBTS to operate on both small populations and non-binary signals.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6451/7276,"Incentive Compatibility, Truth Elicitation, Mechanism Design"

Using more expressive representation would result in dense graphs, making these methods impractical for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose an effective CRF model with linear scale-up properties regarding approximate learning and inference for structured regression on large, fully connected graphs. The proposed method is validated on real-world large-scale problems of image de-noising and remote sensing. In conducted experiments, we demonstrated that dense connectivity provides an improvement in prediction accuracy.

Such an exploration setting is applicable to various multi-agent systems, e.g., in Dynamic Spectrum Access exploration.  The goal in such problems is to optimize the process as a whole, considering the tradeoffs between the quality of the solution obtained and the cost associated with the exploration and coordination between the agents. Through the analysis of the two extreme cases where coordination is completely free and when entirely disabled, we manage to extract the solution for the general case where coordination is taken to be costly, modeled as a fee that needs to be paid for each additional coordinated agent. The strategy structure for the general case is shown to be threshold-based, and the thresholds which are analytically derived in this paper can be calculated offline, resulting in a very low online computational load.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6224/7281,Multi-Agent Exploration; Cooperation; Coordination; Dynamic spectrum access networks
126,2013,Main Technical Papers,Enforcing Meter in Finite-Length Markov Sequences,"Pierre Roy, Francois Pachet","Markov processes are increasingly used to generate finite-length sequences that imitate a given style. However, Markov processes are notoriously difficult to control. Recently, Markov constraints have been introduced to give users some control on generated sequences. Markov constraints reformulate finite-length Markov sequence generation in the framework of constraint satisfaction (CSP). However, in practice, this approach is limited to local constraints and its performance is low for global constraints, such as cardinality or arithmetic constraints. This limitation prevents generated sequences to follow structural properties which are independent of the style, but inherent to the domain, such as meter. In this article, we introduce meter, a constraint that ensures a sequence is 1) Markovian with regards to a given corpus and 2) follows metrical rules expressed as cumulative cost functions. Additionally, meter can simultaneously enforce cardinality constraints. We propose a domain consistency algorithm whose complexity is pseudo-polynomial. This result is obtained thanks to a theorem on the growth of sumsets by Khovanskii. We illustrate our constraint on meter-constrained music generation problems that were so far not solvable by any other technique.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6422/7284,Constraint; Markov chains; Meter; Music

Recent lifelong learning algorithms have achieved nearly identical performance to batch multi-task learning methods while reducing learning time by three orders of magnitude. In this paper, we further improve the scalability of lifelong learning by developing curriculum selection methods that enable an agent to actively select the next task to learn in order to maximize performance on future learning tasks. We demonstrate that active task selection is highly reliable and effective, allowing an agent to learn high performance models using up to 50% fewer tasks than when the agent has no control over the task order. We also explore a variant of transfer learning in the lifelong learning setting in which the agent can focus knowledge acquisition toward a particular target task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6463/7285,lifelong learning; multi-task learning; active learning; curriculum selection

Conventional learning methods optimize the evaluation function parameters by using the game records of expert players in order to imitate their plays. Such conventional methods utilize objective functions to increase the agreement between the moves selected by game-playing programs and the moves in the records of actual games. The methods, however, have a problem in that increasing the agreement does not always improve the strength of a program. Indeed, it is not clear how this agreement relates to the strength of a trained program. To address this problem, this paper presents a learning method to optimize objective function parameters for strength in game-playing. The proposed method employs an evolutionary learning algorithm with the strengths (Elo ratings) of programs as their fitness scores. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective since programs using the objective function produced by the proposed method are superior to those using conventional objective functions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6402/7286,

Moreover, the energy models available are often not very informative particularly when spatially similar structures are compared during search. We introduce several novel heuristics to augment the energy model and present a new local search algorithm that exploits these heuristics in a mixed fashion. Although the heuristics individually are weaker in performance than the energy function, their combination interestingly produces stronger results.

Furthermore, we propose a notion of hypothesis ``plausibility'' under unreliable observations, which we model as plan quality. We then show that in the presence of unreliable observations, simply finding one most ``plausible'' hypothesis, although challenging, is not sufficient for effective malware detection. To that end, we propose a method for applying a state-of-the-art planner within a principled exploration process, to generate multiple distinct high-quality plans. We experimentally evaluate this approach by generating random problems of varying hardness both with respect to the number of observations, as well as the degree of unreliability. Based on these experiments, we argue that our approach presents a significant improvement over prior work that are focused on finding a single optimal plan, and that our hypothesis exploration application can motivate the development of new planners capable of generating the top high-quality plans.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6080/7288,Planning; Application; Reasoning about actions; Model-based reasoning

Unfortunately, Gibbs sampling, a popular MCMC technique, does not converge to the correct answers in presence of determinism and therefore cannot be used for inference in such models. In this paper, we propose to remedy this problem by combining Gibbs sampling with SampleSearch, an advanced importance sampling technique which leverages complete SAT/CSP solvers to generate high quality samples from hard deterministic spaces. We call the resulting algorithm, GiSS. Unlike Gibbs sampling which yields unweighted samples, GiSS yields weighted samples. Computing these weights exactly can be computationally expensive and therefore we propose several approximations. We show that our approximate weighting schemes yield consistent estimates and demonstrate experimentally that GiSS is competitive in terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art algorithms such as SampleSearch, MC-SAT and Belief propagation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6355/7292,Probabilistic Graphical Models; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Gibbs Sampling; Importance Sampling; Machine Learning; Statistical Models

Many existing methods rely on the assumption that the network structure is completely known by the model. However, in many applications, such a network is either unavailable or insufficient to explain the underlying information diffusion phenomena. To address this challenge, we develop a multi-task sparse linear influence model (MSLIM), which can simultaneously predict the volume for each contagion and automatically identify sets of the most influential nodes for different contagions. Our method is based on the linear influence model with two main advantages: 1) it does not require the network structure; 2) it can detect different sets of the most influential nodes for different contagions. To solve the corresponding convex optimization problem for learning the model, we adopt the accelerated gradient method (AGM) framework and show that there is an exact closed-form solution for the proximal mapping. Therefore, the optimization procedure achieves the optimal first-order convergence rate and can be scaled to very large datasets. The proposed model is validated on a set of 2.6 millions tweets from 1000 users of Twitter. We show that MSLIM can efficiently select the most influential users for specific contagions.

Yet SLS algorithms continue to use best improving moves. We revisit this issue by studying very large random and industrial MAXSAT problems. Because locating best improving moves is more expensive than first improving moves, we designed an “approximate best” improving move algorithm and prove that it is as efficient as first improving move SLS. For industrial problems the first local optima found using best improving moves are statistically significantly better than local optima found using first improving moves.

We integrate this technique with A*, assess its theoretical properties, and empirically evaluate its performance across seven benchmark domains.  In the best case, it yields a factor of six reduction in node expansions and CPU time compared to A*, and in the worst case, its overhead is provably bounded by a user-supplied parameter, such as 1%.

One important aspect of competence is the ability to plan, which entails the ability to learn models of the agent’s own actions and their effects on the environment. In this paper we describe an approach to learn action models of environments with continuous-valued spatial states and realistic physics consisting of multiple interacting rigid objects. In such environments, we hypothesize that objects exhibit multiple qualitatively distinct behaviors we call modes, conditioned on their spatial relationships to each other. We argue that action models that explicitly represent these modes using a combination of symbolic spatial relationships and continuous metric information learn faster, generalize better, and make more accurate predictions than models that only use metric information. We present a method to learn action models with piecewise linear modes conditioned on a combination of first order Horn clauses that test symbolic spatial predicates and continuous classifiers. We empirically demonstrate that our method learns more accurate and more general models of a physics simulation than a method that learns a single function (locally weighted regression).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6450/7317,Action Modeling

A temporal milestone of a task is an intermediate event that occurs during the execution of a complex task, e.g., the start time, the end time or a milestone of any of its subtasks.  Unlike landmark variables, introduced in existing work, temporal milestones respect the task abstraction boundaries and preserve structural properties enabling much more efficient reasoning. Furthermore, temporal milestones are as expressive as landmark variables. We provide analytical and empirical evidence to  support these claims.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6345/7321,temporal reasoning; HTN planning
148,2013,Main Technical Papers,Joint Object and Pose Recognition Using Homeomorphic Manifold Analysis,"Haopeng Zhang, Tarek El-Gaaly, Ahmed Elgammal, Zhiguo Jiang","Object recognition is a key precursory challenge in the fields of object manipulation and robotic/AI visual reasoning in general. Recognizing object categories, particular instances of objects and viewpoints/poses of objects are three critical subproblems robots must solve in order to accurately grasp/manipulate objects and reason about their environ- ments. Multi-view images of the same object lie on intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds in descriptor spaces (e.g. visual/depth descriptor spaces). These object manifolds share the same topology despite being geometrically different. Each object manifold can be represented as a deformed version of a unified manifold. The object manifolds can thus be parametrized by its homeomorphic mapping/reconstruction from the unified manifold. In this work, we construct a manifold descriptor from this mapping between homeomorphic manifolds and use it to jointly solve the three challenging recognition sub-problems. We extensively experiment on a challenging multi-modal (i.e. RGBD) dataset and other object pose datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6376/7325,"vision; kinect; object recognition; machine learning, multi-modal visual learning"

A general challenge is to design efficient human computation algorithms or workflows with which to coordinate the work of the crowd. We introduce a method for automated workflow synthesis aimed at ideally harnessing human efforts by learning about the crowd's performance on tasks and synthesizing an optimal workflow for solving a problem.

In this paper we propose a novel construction approach for MCP. In particular, we show that MCP can be derived from a concave conjugate of the Euclidean distance function. This construction approach in turn leads us to an augmented Lagrange multiplier method for solving the penalized regression problem with MCP. In our method each tuning parameter corresponds to a feature, and these tuning parameters can be automatically updated. We also develop a d.c. (difference of convex functions) programming approach for the penalized regression problem. We find that the augmented Lagrange multiplier method degenerates into the d.c. programming method under specific conditions. Experimental analysis is conducted on a set of simulated data. The result is encouraging.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6325/7330,"MCP, Concave Conjugate, Regression"
151,2013,Main Technical Papers,Smart Multi-Task Bregman Clustering and Multi-Task Kernel Clustering,"Xianchao Zhang, Xiaotong Zhang","Multitask Bregman Clustering (MBC) alternatively updates clusters and learns relationship between clusters of different tasks, and the two phases boost each other. However, the boosting does not always have positive effect, it may also cause negative effect. Another issue of MBC is that it cannot deal with nonlinear separable data. In this paper, we show that MBC's process of using cluster relationship to boost the updating clusters phase may cause negative effect, i.e., cluster centroid may be skewed under some conditions. We propose a smart multi-task Bregman clustering (S-MBC) algorithm which identifies negative effect of the boosting and avoids the negative effect if it occurs. We then extend the framework of S-MBC to a smart multi-task kernel clustering (S-MKC) framework to deal with nonlinear separable data. We also propose a specific implementation of the framework which could be applied to any Mercer kernel.

In order to take into account the underlying multimodes structure information within the model, we propose a framework of probabilistic product kernels for tensorial data based on a generative model assumption.  More specifically, it can be interpreted  as mapping tensors to probability density function space and measuring similarity by an  information divergence. Since tensor kernels enable us to model input tensor observations, the proposed tensor-variate GP is considered as both a generative and discriminative model. Furthermore, a fully  variational Bayesian treatment for multiclass GP classification with multinomial probit likelihood is employed to estimate the hyperparameters and infer the predictive distributions. Simulation results on both synthetic data and a real world application of human action recognition in videos demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach for classification of multiway tensor data, especially in the case that  the underlying  structure information among multimodes is discriminative for the classification task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6191/7334,Tensor; Gaussian processes; Classification; Kernel
153,2013,Main Technical Papers,Time-Dependent Trajectory Regression on Road Networks via Multi-Task Learning,"Jiangchuan Zheng, Lionel M. Ni","Road travel costs are important knowledge hidden in large-scale GPS trajectory data sets, the discovery of which can benefit many applications such as intelligent route planning and automatic driving navigation. While there are previous studies which tackled this task by modeling it as a regression problem with spatial smoothness taken into account, they unreasonably assumed that the latent cost of each road remains unchanged over time. Other works on route planning and recommendation that have considered temporal factors simply assumed that the temporal dynamics be known in advance as a parametric function over time, which is not faithful to reality. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose an extension to a previous static trajectory regression framework by learning the temporal dynamics of road travel costs in an innovative non-parametric manner which can effectively overcome the temporal sparsity problem. In particular, we unify multiple different trajectory regression problems in a multi-task framework by introducing a novel cross-task regularization which encourages temporal smoothness on the change of road travel costs. We then propose an efficient block coordinate descent method to solve the resulting problem by exploiting its separable structures and prove its convergence to global optimum. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its improved accuracy on travel time prediction.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6232/7336,trajectory mining; temporal smoothness; multi-task learning; fused lasso

However, most work is confined to conjunctions of simple together and apart constraints which limit their usability. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of constrained clustering that is able to incorporate not only existing types of constraints but also more complex logical combinations beyond conjunctions. We first show how any statement in conjunctive normal form (CNF) can be represented as a linear inequality. Since existing clustering formulations such as spectral clustering cannot easily incorporate these linear inequalities, we propose a quadratic programming (QP) clustering formulation to accommodate them. This new formulation allows us to have much more complex guidance in clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two applications on text and personal information management. We also compare our algorithm against existing constrained spectral clustering algorithm to show its efficiency in computational time.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6426/7338,

In this paper, we introduce coupled dictionary learning (DL) into supervised sparse coding for multi-modal (cross-media) retrieval. We call this Supervised coupled dictionary learning with group structures for Multi-Modal retrieval (SliM2). SliM2 formulates the multi-modal mapping as a constrained dictionary learning problem. By utilizing the intrinsic power of DL to deal with the heterogeneous features, SliM2 extends unimodal DL to multi-modal DL. Moreover, the label information is employed in SliM2 to discover the shared structure inside intra-modality within the same class by a mixed norm (i.e., `l1/l2`-norm). As a result, the multimodal retrieval is conducted via a set of jointly learned mapping functions across multi-modal data.

In this paper, we consider a novel solution for this challenge that combines generative planning on incomplete domain models with a library of plan cases that are known to be correct. While this was arguably the original motivation for case-based planning, most existing case-based planners assume (and depend on) from-scratch planners that work on complete domain models. In contrast, our approach views the plan generated with respect to the incomplete model as a ``skeletal plan'' and augments it with directed mining of plan fragments from library cases.

158,2013,Artificial Intelligence and the Web Special Track,Preventing Unraveling in Social Networks Gets Harder,"Rajesh Hemant Chitnis, Fedor V. Fomin, Petr A. Golovach","The behavior of users in social networks is often observed to be affected by the actions of their friends. Bhawalkar et al. (ICALP '12) introduced a formal mathematical model for user engagement in social networks where each individual derives a benefit proportional to the number of its friends which are engaged. Given a threshold degree k the equilibrium for this model is a maximal subgraph whose minimum degree is at least k. However the dropping out of individuals with degrees less than k might lead to a cascading effect of iterated withdrawals such that the size of equilibrium subgraph becomes very small. To overcome this some special vertices called ""anchors"" are introduced: these vertices need not have large degree. Bhawalkar et al. considered the Anchored k-Core problem: Given a graph G and integers b, k and p do there exist sets of vertices B, H such that B is a subset of H, size of B is at most b and size of H is at least p, and every vertex v which is in H but not in B has degree at least k in the induced subgraph G[H]. They showed that the problem is NP-hard for all k greater equal 2, and gave some inapproximability and fixed-parameter intractability results. In this paper we give improved hardness results for this problem. In particular we show that the Anchored k-Core problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by p, even for k=3. This improves the result of Bhawalkar et al.  (who show W[2]-hardness parameterized by b) as our parameter is always bigger since p is greater equal than b. Then we answer a question of Bhawalkar et al. by showing that the Anchored k-Core problem remains NP-hard on planar graphs for all k greater equal 3, even if the maximum degree of the graph is k+2. Finally we show that the problem is FPT on planar graphs parameterized by b for all k greater equal 7.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6313/6872,"Social networks, parameterized complexity, planar graphs"

However, current models ignore psychological factors that play an important role in shaping online social behavior. One such factor is attention, the mechanism that integrates perceptual and cognitive features to select the items the user will consciously process and may eventually adopt. Recent research has shown that people have finite attention, which constrains their online interactions, and that they divide their limited attention non-uniformly over other people. We propose a collaborative topic regression model that incorporates limited, non-uniformly divided attention. We show that the proposed model is able to learn more accurate user preferences than state-of-art models, which do not take human cognitive factors into account. Specifically we analyze voting on news items on the social news aggregator and show that our model is better able to predict held out votes than alternate models.

Ren, Wei Wang, Jiawei Wang, Stephen Liao","With the proliferation of its applications in various industries, sentiment analysis by using publicly available web data has become an active research area in text classification during these years. It is argued by researchers that semi-supervised learning is an effective approach to this problem since it is capable to mitigate the manual labeling effort which is usually expensive and time-consuming. However, there was a long-term debate on the effectiveness of unlabeled data in text classification. This was partially caused by the fact that many assumptions in theoretic analysis often do not hold in practice. We argue that this problem may be further understood by adding an additional dimension in the experiment. This allows us to address this problem in the perspective of bias and variance in a broader view. We show that the well-known performance degradation issue caused by unlabeled data can be reproduced as a subset of the whole scenario. We argue that if the bias-variance trade-off is to be better balanced by a more effective feature selection method unlabeled data is very likely to boost the classification performance. We then propose a feature selection framework in which labeled and unlabeled training samples are both considered. We discuss its potential in achieving such a balance.

It is common to crowdsource annotation tasks and aggregate responses to estimate the true annotation.

In our work, we bridge this gap and present a combined query answering approach for ELHO--a logic that contains all features of the OWL 2 EL standard apart from transitive roles and complex role inclusions. This extension is nontrivial because nominals require equality reasoning, which introduces complexity into the first and the third step.

Many of these markets compensate workers with monetary payments. We study the effects of performance-contingent financial rewards on work quality and worker effort in MTurk via two experiments. We find that the magnitude of performance-contingent financial rewards alone affects neither quality nor effort. However, when workers working on two tasks of the same type in a sequence, the change in the magnitude of the reward over the two tasks affects both. In particular, both work quality and worker effort increase (alternatively decrease) as the reward increases (alternatively decreases) for the second task. This suggests the existence of the anchoring effect on workers’ perception of incentives in MTurk and that this effect can be leveraged in workflow design to increase the effectiveness of financial incentives.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6301/6887,

User demand a new type of cross-media retrieval where user can search results across various media by submitting query of any media. Since the query and the retrieved results can be of different media, how to learn a heterogeneous metric is the key challenge. Most existing metric learning algorithms only focus on a single media where all of the media objects share the same data representation. In this paper, we propose a joint graph regularized heterogeneous metric learning (JGRHML) algorithm, which integrates the structure of different media into a joint graph regularization. In JGRHML, different media are complementary to each other and optimizing them simultaneously can make the solution smoother for both media and further improve the accuracy of the final metric.

175,2013,Artificial Intelligence and the Web Special Track,Active Transfer Learning for Cross-System Recommendation,"Lili Zhao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Evan Wei Xiang, Erheng Zhong, Zhongqi Lu, Qiang Yang","Recommender systems, especially the newly launched ones, have to deal with the data-sparsity issue, where little existing rating information is available. Recently, transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging the knowledge from related recommender systems where rich collaborative data are available. However, most previous transfer learning models assume that entity-correspondences across different systems are given as input, which means that for any entity (e.g., a user or an item) in a target system, its corresponding entity in a source system is known. This assumption can hardly be satisfied in real-world scenarios where entity-correspondences across systems are usually unknown, and the cost of identifying them can be expensive.  For example, it is extremely difficult to identify whether a user A from Facebook and a user B from Twitter are the same person. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct entity correspondence with limited budget by using active learning to facilitate knowledge transfer across recommender systems. Specifically, for the purpose of maximizing knowledge transfer, we first iteratively select entities in the target system based on our proposed criterion to query their correspondences in the source system. We then plug the actively constructed entity-correspondence mapping into a general transferred collaborative-filtering model to improve recommendation quality. We perform extensive experiments on real world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework for this cross-system recommendation problem.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6233/6889,

Deeper understanding and appropriate generation of indirect acts will require mechanisms that integrate natural language (NL) understanding and generation with social information about agent roles and obligations,which we introduce in this paper. Additionally, we tackle the problem of understanding and handling indirect answers that take the form of either speech acts or physical actions, which requires an inferential, plan-reasoning approach. In order to enable artificial agents to handle an even wider-variety of ISAs, we present a hybrid approach, utilizing both the idiomatic and inferential strategies.

Currently, the vast majority of  models for appraisal in synthetic characters consider factors related to the goals and preferences of the characters. We argue that appraisals that only take into consideration these ""personal"" factors are incomplete as other more social factors, such as the normative and the social context, including in-group and out-group relations, should be considered as well. Without them, moral emotions such as shame cannot be appraised, limiting the believability of the characters in certain situations. We present a model for the appraisal of characters' actions that evaluates whether actions by in-group and out-group members which conform, or not, to social norms generate different emotions depending on the social relations between the characters. The model was then implemented in an architecture for virtual agents and evaluated with humans. Results suggest that the emotions generated by our model are perceived by the participants, taking into account the social context and that participants experienced very similar emotions, both in type and intensity, to the emotions appraised and generated by the characters.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6416/6866,Appraisal; Social Relations; Norms; Normative Events; Emotions

Goals that remain suspended for long periods, however, are prone to be forgotten. This paper presents a class of preemptive strategies that allow agents to selectively retain goals in memory and to recover forgotten goals. Preemptive strategies work by retrieving and rehearsing goals at triggers, which are either periodic or are predictive of the opportunity to act. Since cognitive architectures contain common hierarchies of memory systems and share similar forgetting mechanisms, these strategies work across multiple architectures.

The scheme can employ the services of either individual or cooperating consumer agents alike. Agents participating in the scheme, however, are motivated to form cooperatives, in order to reduce their electricity bills via lower group prices granted for sizable consumption shifting from high to low demand time intervals. The scheme takes into account individual costs, and uses a strictly proper scoring rule to reward contributors according to efficiency. Cooperative members, in particular, can attain variable reduced electricity price rates, given their different load shifting capabilities. This allows even agents with initially forbidding shifting costs to participate in the scheme, and is achieved by a weakly budget-balanced, truthful reward sharing mechanism.

Simulators in natural resource management can be very expensive to execute, so that the time required to solve such MDPs is dominated by the number of calls to the simulator. This paper presents an algorithm, DDV, that combines improved confidence intervals on the Q values (as in interval estimation) with a novel upper bound on the discounted state occupancy probabilities to intelligently choose state-action pairs to explore. We prove that this algorithm terminates with a policy whose value is within epsilon of the optimal policy (with probability 1-delta) after making only polynomially-many calls to the simulator.

As a result, accurately identifying and tracking such phenomena are crucial for understanding ocean dynamics and marine ecosystem sustainability. Traditionally, ocean eddies are monitored through two phases: identification and tracking. A major challenge for such an approach is that the tracking phase is dependent on the performance of the identification scheme, which can be susceptible to noise and sampling errors. In this paper, we focus on tracking, and introduce the concept of multiple hypothesis assignment (MHA), which extends traditional multiple hypothesis tracking for cases where the features tracked are noisy or uncertain. Under this scheme, features are assigned to multiple potential tracks, and the final assignment is deferred until more data are available to make a relatively unambiguous decision. Unlike the most widely used methods in the eddy tracking literature, MHA uses contextual spatio-temporal information to take corrective measures autonomously on the detection step a pos- teriori and performs significantly better in the presence of noise.

To compensate for the increased variability in supply and demand, we need algorithms for online energy resource allocation under temporal uncertainty of future consumption and availability. Recent advances in prediction algorithms offer hope that a reduction in future uncertainty, through short term predictions, will increase the worth of the renewables. Predictive information is then revealed incrementally in an online manner, leading to what we call dynamic temporal uncertainty. We demonstrate the non-triviality of this problem and provide online algorithms, both randomized and deterministic, to handle time varying uncertainty in future rewards for non-stationary MDPs in general and for energy resource allocation in particular. We derive theoretical upper and lower bounds that hold even for a finite horizon, and establish that, in the deterministic case, discounting future rewards can be used as a strategy to maximize the total (undiscounted) reward.

In the face of human development and climate change, it is important that conservation plans for protecting landscape connectivity exhibit certain level of robustness. While previous work has focused on conservation strategies that result in a connected network of habitat reserves, the robustness of the proposed solutions has not been taken into account. In order to address this important aspect, we formalize the problem as a node-weighted bi-criteria network design problem with connectivity requirements on the number of disjoint paths between pairs of nodes. While in most previous work on survivable network design the objective is to minimize the cost of the selected network, our goal is to optimize the quality of the selected paths within a specified budget, while meeting the connectivity requirements. We characterize the complexity of the problem under different restrictions. We provide a mixed-integer programming encoding that allows for finding solutions with optimality guarantees, as well as a hybrid local search method with better scaling behavior but no guarantees.

We present models and learning algorithms for autonomous agents that can address the tariff selection problem on behalf of customers. We introduce 'Negotiated Learning', a general algorithm that enables a self-interested sequential decision-making agent to periodically select amongst a variable set of 'entities' (e.g., tariffs) by negotiating with other agents in the environment to gather information about dynamic partially observable entity 'features' (e.g., tariff prices) that affect the entity selection decision.

However, for diseases which are not regulated, individual farmers are responsible for the adoption and successful application of control policies at the farm scale. Organizations (groups of farmers, health institutions...) may try to influence farmers' control actions through financial incentives, in order to ensure sustainable (from the health and economical point of views) disease management policies. Economics / Operations Research frameworks have been proposed for modeling the effect of incentives on agents. The Leader-Follower Markov Decision Processes framework is one such framework, that combines Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and stochastic games frameworks. However, since finding equilibrium policies in stochastic games is hard when the number of players is large, LF-MDP problems are intractable. Our contribution, in this article, is to propose a tractable model of the animal disease management problem. The tractable model is obtained through a few simple modeling approximations which are acceptable when the problem is viewed from the organization side.

Trends in changing climates, fire occurrence and the expansion of the wildland-urban interface all point to increased resource shortages in the future.  One approach for coping with these shortages has been the sharing of resources across different wildland-fire agencies. This introduces new issues as agencies have to balance their own needs and risk-management with their desire to help fellow agencies in need.

In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group and consumers make their own consumption decisions based on their private consumption constraints and preferences. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, we propose an iterative algorithm in which a virtual price signal is sent by the coordinator to induce consumers to shift demand.

202,2013,Robotics Special Track,Inferring Robot Task Plans from Human Team Meetings: A Generative Modeling Approach with Logic-Based Prior,"Been Kim, Caleb Chacha, Julie Shah","We aim to reduce the burden of programming and deploying autonomous systems to work in concert with people in time-critical domains, such as military field operations and disaster response. Deployment plans for these operations are frequently negotiated on-the-fly by teams of human planners. A human operator then translates the agreed upon plan into machine instructions for the robots. We present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the final plan from a processed form of the human team's planning conversation. Our approach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan validation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans. This hybrid approach enables us to overcome the challenge of performing inference over the large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session. We validate the algorithm through human subject experimentation and show we are able to infer a human team's final plan with 83% accuracy on average. We also describe a robot demonstration in which two people plan and execute a first-response collaborative task with a PR2 robot. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates a logical planning technique within a generative model to perform plan inference.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6394/6841,generative modeling; robotics; rescue mission; machine learning
203,2013,Robotics Special Track,Data-Efficient Generalization of Robot Skills with Contextual Policy Search,"Andras Gabor Kupcsik, Marc Peter Deisenroth, Jan Peters, Gerhard Neumann","In robotics, controllers make the robot solve a task within a  specific context. The context can describe the objectives of the robot or physical properties of the environment and is always specified before task execution. To generalize the controller to multiple contexts, we follow a hierarchical approach for policy learning: A lower-level policy controls the robot for a given context and an upper-level policy generalizes among contexts.  Current approaches for learning such upper-level policies are based  on model-free policy search, which require an excessive number of  interactions of the robot with its environment. More data-efficient policy search approaches are model based but, thus far, without the capability of learning hierarchical policies. We propose a new model-based policy search approach that can also learn contextual upper-level policies. Our approach is based on learning probabilistic forward models for long-term predictions. Using these predictions, we use information-theoretic insights to improve the upper-level policy. Our method achieves a substantial improvement in learning speed compared to existing methods on simulated and real robotic tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6322/6842,robotics; policy search; gaussian process; movement skill learning; generalization of skills
204,2013,Robotics Special Track,GSMDPs for Multi-Robot Sequential Decision-Making,"João Vicente Messias, Matthijs Spaan, Pedro Lima","Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide an extensive theoretical background for problems of decision-making under uncertainty. In order to maintain computational tractability, however, real-world problems are typically discretized in states and actions as well as in time. Assuming synchronous state transitions and actions at fixed rates may result in models which are not strictly Markovian, or where agents are forced to idle between actions, losing their ability to react to sudden changes in the environment. In this work, we explore the application of Generalized Semi-Markov Decision Processes (GSMDPs) to a realistic multi-robot scenario. A case study will be presented in the domain of cooperative robotics, where real-time reactivity must be preserved, and synchronous discrete-time approaches are therefore sub-optimal. This case study is tested on a team of real robots, and also in realistic simulation. By allowing asynchronous events to be modeled over continuous time, the GSMDP approach is shown to provide greater solution quality than its discrete-time counterparts, while still being approximately solvable by existing methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6432/6843,Markov Decision Processes; Sequential Decision Making; Multi-Robot Systems

Each step of the hybrid search consists of expanding a frontier of regions in the discrete space using cost heuristics as guide followed by sampling-based motion planning to expand a tree of feasible motions in the continuous space to reach the frontier. The approach is geared towards robots with many degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), nonlinear dynamics, and nonholonomic constraints, which make it difficult to follow discrete-search paths to the goal, and hence require a tight coupling of motion planning and discrete search. Comparisons to related work show significant computational speedups.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6254/6844,Motion planning; discrete search; dynamics

However, a  need is arising for robots that do not just replicate the task on  their own, but that also interact with humans in a safe and  natural way to accomplish tasks cooperatively. Robots with  variable impedance capabilities opens the door to new  challenging applications, where the learning algorithms must  be extended by encapsulating force and vision information. In  this paper we propose a framework to transfer impedance-based  behaviors to a torque-controlled robot by kinesthetic teaching.  The proposed model encodes the examples as a  task-parameterized statistical dynamical system, where the  robot impedance is shaped by estimating virtual stiffness  matrices from the set of demonstrations. A collaborative  assembly task is used as testbed. The results show that the  model can be used to modify the robot impedance along task  execution to facilitate the collaboration, by triggering stiff and  compliant behaviors in an on-line manner to adapt to the  user's actions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6243/6845,Physical human-robot interaction; collaborative manipulation; impedance learning; task-parameterized model

Our method decomposes a set of colored point clouds into local  surface patches and encodes them based on an overcomplete dictionary.  Instead of storing the entire point cloud, we store a dictionary,  surface patch positions, and a sparse code description of the depth and  RGB attributes for every patch.  The dictionary is learned in an  unsupervised way from surface patches sampled from indoor maps. We show  that better dictionaries can be learned by extending the K-SVD method  with a binary weighting scheme that ignores undefined surface cells.  Through experimental evaluation on real world laser and RGBD datasets  we demonstrate that our method produces compact and accurate models.   Furthermore, we clearly outperform an existing state of the art method  in terms of compactness, accuracy, and computation time. Additionally,  we demonstrate that our sparse code descriptions can be utilized for  other important tasks such as object detection.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6400/6846,"RGBD, surface models, sparse coding"

These are hallmark challenges for important problems, such as humanoid locomotion. In order to ensure broad applicability, we assume domain expertise is minimal and limited to a generative model. In order to make the method responsive, computational costs that scale linearly with the amount of samples taken from the generative model are required. We bring to bear a concrete method that satisfies all these requirements; it is a receding-horizon open-loop planner that employs cross-entropy optimization for policy construction. In simulation, we empirically demonstrate near-optimal decisions in a small domain and effective locomotion in several challenging humanoid control tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6341/6847,reinforcement learning; receding horizon control; continuous Markov decision processes

Our results encompass three formulations of the discrete multi-robot path planning problem, including a variant that allows synchronous rotations of robots along fully occupied, disjoint cycles on the graph. Allowing rotation of robots provides a more natural model for multi-robot path planning because robots can communicate.Our optimality objectives are to minimize the total arrival time, the makespan (last arrival time), and the total distance. On the structure side, we show that, in general, these objectives demonstrate a pairwise Pareto optimal structure and cannot be simultaneously optimized. On the computational complexity side, we extend previous work and show that, regardless of the underlying multi-robot path planning problem, these objectives are all intractable to compute. In particular, our NP-hardness proof for the time optimal versions, based on a minimal and direct reduction from the 3-satisfiability problem, shows that these problems remain NP-hard even when there are only two groups of robots (i.e. robots within each group are interchangeable).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6111/6848,multi-robot path planning; Pareto optimality; NP-hardness

In this paper, we describe a deployed automated antimicrobial prescription surveillance system that has been assisting hospital pharmacists in identifying and reporting inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions. One of the key characteristics of this system is its ability to learn new rules for detecting inappropriate prescriptions based on previous false alerts. The supervised learning algorithm combines instance-based learning and rule induction techniques. It exploits temporal abstraction to extract a meaningful time interval representation from raw clinical data, and applies nearest neighbor classification with a distance function on both temporal and non-temporal parameters.

This means that reports must be ""readable"" to humans and machines alike. In order to improve reporting practices in breast imaging, we allow the radiologist to write structured reports with a special pen on paper with an invisible dot pattern. In this way, we provide a knowledge acquisition system for printed mammography patient forms for the combined work with printed and digital documents. In this domain, printed documents cannot be easily replaced by computer systems because they contain free-form sketches and textual annotations, and the acceptance of traditional PC reporting tools is rather low among the doctors. This is due to the fact that current electronic reporting systems significantly add to the amount of time it takes to complete the reports. We describe our real-time digital paper application and focus on the use case study of our deployed application. We think that our results motivate the design and implementation of intuitive pen based user interfaces for the medical reporting process and similar knowledge work domains.

GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicant’s file that matter the most.

Most of the existing crowdsourcing services prohibit requesters from posting illegal or objectionable tasks. Operators in the marketplaces have to monitor the tasks continuously to find such improper tasks; however, it is too expensive to manually investigate each task. In this paper, we present the reports of our trial study on automatic detection of improper tasks to support the monitoring of activities by marketplace operators. We perform experiments using real task data from a commercial crowdsourcing marketplace and show that the classifier trained by the operator judgments achieves high accuracy in detecting improper tasks. In addition, to reduce the annotation costs of the operator and improve the classification accuracy, we consider the use of crowdsourcing for task annotation. We hire a group of crowdsourcing (non-expert) workers to monitor posted tasks, and incorporate their judgments into the training data of the classifier. By applying quality control techniques to handle the variability in worker reliability, our results show that the use of non-expert judgments by crowdsourcing workers in combination with expert judgments improves the accuracy of detecting improper crowdsourcing tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI13/paper/viewFile/6150/6424,"crowdsourcing, human computation, quality control"

We describe a real-time application that would reduce these risks in terms of a real-time thermal-work strain index (SI) estimator; and a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to compute optimal work rate policies. We examined the thermo-physiological responses of 14 experienced U.S. Army Ranger students (26±4 years 1.77±0.04 m; 78.3±7.3 kg) who participated in a strenuous 8 mile time-restricted pass/fail road march conducted under thermally stressful conditions. A thermoregulatory model was used to derive SI state transition probabilities and model the students’ observed and policy driven movement rates. We found that policy end-state SI was significantly lower than SI when modeled using the student’s own movement rates (3.94±0.88 vs. 5.62±1.20, P<0.001). We also found an inverse relationship between our policy impact and maximum SI (r=0.64 P<0.05). These results suggest that modeling real world missions as an MDP can provide optimal work rate policies that improve thermal safety and allow students to finish in a “fresher” state. Ultimately, SI state estimation and MDP models incorporated into wearable physiological monitoring systems could provide real-time work rate guidance, thus minimizing thermal work-strain while maximizing the likelihood of accomplishing mission tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI13/paper/viewFile/6159/6426,

219,2013,Emerging Application Papers,Train Outstable Scheduling as Constraint Satisfaction,Andy Hon Wai Chun,"This paper outlines the design of a scheduling algorithm that allocates outstabling locations to railway trains. From time to time railway trains may need to be outstabled to temporary locations, such as stations, sidings, depots, etc., until they are needed for regular operations. This is common for urban rail transit, and especially so for those that do not operate 24 hours. During non-traffic hours (NTH), trains are outstabled to various locations along the rail network so that when operations start again next day, the trains will be nearby their originating station or conveniently located so that they can be put into service whenever needed. However, this is complicated by the fact that engineering works, such as rail testing, installation, regular maintenance, etc. are done during the NTH. Therefore, passenger trains must be outstabled in such a way that they do not interfere with night-time engineering works or the movements of associated engineering trains. Since the engineering works scheduling is done separate to outstabling, this is a mixed-system problem. This paper shows how we modeled this as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) and implemented into an “Outstabling System” (OSS) for the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) using a two-stage search algorithm.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI13/paper/viewFile/6169/6428,"scheduling, optimization, constraint-satisfaction"

To our knowledge, this paper describes the first effort toward automating this enhanced functionality. Under a very tight running-time budget, our approach reliably detects the start of a play in an arbitrary football video with minimal assumptions about the scene, viewpoint, video resolution and shot quality.

Today's datasets from longitudinal studies offer great promise to uncover these interactions but also pose enormous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with potential long-range interactions over time.Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcification (CAC) levels --- an indicator of the risk of CHD present subclinically in an individual --- significantly better than traditional non-relational approaches.The uncovered long-range interactions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledgeand are successful in identifying risk factors at the early adult stage.

This paper introduces a case-based meta-predictor that combines a set of elaborate, pre-existing predictors to improve their accuracy on a difficult and important problem: protein-ligand docking. The method focuses on the reliability of its component predictors, and has broad potential applications in biology and chemistry. Despite noisy and biased input, the method outperforms its individual components on benchmark data. It provides a promising solution for the performance improvement of compound virtual screening, which would thereby reduce the time and cost of drug discovery.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI13/paper/viewFile/6214/6437,Meta-Prediction; Case-Based Reasoning; Protein-Ligand Docking
229,2013,Emerging Application Papers,Physical Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Data Using a Multi-Scale Ensemble Method,"Yonglei Zheng, Weng-Keen Wong, Xinze Guan, Stewart Trost","Accurate and detailed measurement of an individual's physical activity is a key requirement for helping researchers understand the relationship between physical activity and health. Accelerometers have become the method of choice for measuring physical activity due to their small size, low cost, convenience and their ability to provide objective information about physical activity. However, interpreting accelerometer data once it has been collected can be challenging. In this work, we applied machine learning algorithms to the task of physical activity recognition from triaxial accelerometer data. We employed a simple but effective approach of dividing the accelerometer data into short non-overlapping windows, converting each window into a feature vector, and treating each feature vector as an i.i.d training instance for a supervised learning algorithm. In addition, we improved on this simple approach with a multi-scale ensemble method that did not need to commit to a single window size and was able to leverage the fact that physical activities produced time series with repetitive patterns and discriminative features for physical activity occurred at different temporal scales.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI13/paper/viewFile/6373/6438,"Time series classification, ensemble methods, activity recognition"

Goel, Maithilee Kunda, David Joyner, Swaroop Vattam","Many AI courses include design and programming projects that provide students with opportunities for experiential learning. Design and programming projects in courses on knowledge-based AI typically explore topics in knowledge, memory, reasoning, and learning. Traditional AI curricula, however, seldom highlight issues of modality of representations, often focusing solely on propositional representations. In this paper, we report on an investigation into learning about representational modality through a series of projects based around geometric analogy problems similar to the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test of intelligence. We conducted this experiment over three years, from Fall 2010 through Fall 2012, in a class on knowledge-based AI. We used the methodology of action research in which the teacher is also the researcher. We discovered that students found these projects motivating, engaging, and challenging, in several cases investing significant time and posting their work online.

In this paper, we are interested in the performance of both one-against-all and one-against-one for classification algorithms, such as decision tree, naïve bayes, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Since both one-against-all and one-against-one work like creating a classification committee, they are expected to improve the performance of classification algorithms. However, our experimental results surprisingly show that one-against-all worsens the performance of the algorithms on most datasets. One-against-one helps, but performs worse than the same iterations of bagging these algorithms.

240,2013,Pre-PhD Student Abstracts,A Mediation Mechanism for Automated Negotiating Agents Whose Utility Changes over Time,"Keisuke Hara, Takayuki Ito","Multi-issue negotiation protocols are an important field of study because real-world negotiation problems are often complex and involve multiple issues. Although much previous work has only addressed linear utility function, that is, simple negotiations involving independent issues, recently, non-linear utility functions for complex negotiations involing interdependent issues have gained attention. Most studies, however, do not focus on the changes in utility space over time. In economic theory, it is often assumed that the utility function changes dynamically over time. It is important to seek the Pareto front, which refers to the set of Pareto optimal points, in negotiation problems. Therefore, in this paper we propose a complex utility space that changes over time and a negotiation mechanism in which the mediator takes the lead in negotiation based on the genetic algorithm (GA). The experimental results show that our approach is suitable for utility that dynamically changes over time, and finds and follows the Pareto front effectively.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6211/6817,"Multi-Issue Negotiation, Interdependent Issues, change over time, GA"

Our coalition emergence algorithm is based on the heuristic that agents benefit by forming coalitions with wealthy (higher payoff) and influential (higher accumulated coupling strength) neighbors.

Most of these “phase transition” studies were done on SAT instances that follow uniform random distribution. In such a distribution, variables take part in clauses with uniform probability, and clauses are independent (uncorrelated).  The assumptions of uniform random distribution are, however, not satisfied when we consider SAT instances that result from real problems. Our project aims for a deeper understanding of the hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice. In particular, we study two key questions: (1) How does the phase transition behavior change with more realistic and natural distributions of SAT problems? and (2) Can we gain an understanding of the phase transition in terms of the network structure of these SAT problems? Our hypothesis is that the network properties help predict and explain how the easy-to-hard problem transition for realistic SAT problems differs from those for uniform random distribution.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6296/6820,"Boolean Satisfiability, Phase Transition, Social Networks"

Cohn","Learning from imbalanced data is an important problem in data mining research. Much research has addressed the problem of imbalanced data by using sampling methods to generate an equally balanced training set to improve the performance of the prediction models, but it is unclear what ratio of class distribution is best for training a prediction model. Bagging is one of the most popular and effective ensemble learning methods for improving the performance of prediction models; however, there is a major drawback on extremely imbalanced data-sets. It is unclear under which conditions bagging is outperformed by other sampling schemes in terms of imbalanced classification. These issues motivate us to propose a novel approach, unevenly balanced bagging (UBagging) to boost the performance of the prediction model for imbalanced binary classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that UBagging is effective and statistically significantly superior to single learner decision trees J48 (SingleJ48), bagging, and equally balanced bagging (BBagging) on 32 imbalanced data-sets.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6353/6827,"Imbalanced class distribution, Ensemble Learning"

Formal verification incorporates the rigor necessary but not all simulators are generated from formal specifications. Manual inspection is readily available but lacks the rigor and is prone to errors.

Inference graphs enhance propositional graphs by treating propositional nodes as tasks which can be scheduled to operate upon messages sent between nodes via the arcs that already exist as part of the propositional graph representation.

The application of parameterized complexity theory to answer-set programming would give a crucial understanding of how solver heuristics work. This profound understanding can be used to improve the decision heuristics of modern solvers and yields new efficient algorithms for decision problems in the nonmonotonic setting. My research aims to explain the gap between theoretical upper bounds and the effort to solve real-world instances. I will further develop by means of parameterized complexity exact algorithms which work efficiently for real-world instances. The approach is based on backdoors which are small sets of atoms that represent ""clever reasoning shortcuts"" through the search space. The concept of backdoors is widely used in the areas of propositional satisfiability and constraint satisfaction. I will show how this concept can be adapted to the nonmonotonic setting and how it can be utilized to improve common algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6354/6800,knowledge representation; commonsense reasoning; answer-set programming; nonmonotonic reasoning; parameterized complexity theory; backdoors

266,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Creating Model-Based Adaptive Environments Using Game-Specific and Game-Independent Analytics,Brent Edward Harrison,"My research involves creating and evaluating adaptive game environments using player models created with data-driven techniques and algorithms. I hypothesize that I will be able to change parts of a game to elicit certain behaviors from players,and that these changes will also result in an increase of engagement and/or intrinsic motivation. Initial results in my testbed game, Scrabblesque, indicate that data-driven models and techniques can be used to influence player behavior and that these changes in play behavior manifest themselves as an increase in engagement and intrinsic motivation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6337/6802,
267,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Heuristic Search for Large Problems with Real Costs,Matthew Hatem,"Heuristic search is a fundamental technique for solving problems in artificial intelligence. However, many heuristic search algorithms, such as A* are limited by the amount of main memory available. External memory search overcomes the memory limitation of A* by taking advantage of cheap secondary storage, such as disk. Previous work in this area assumes that edge costs fall within a narrow range of integer values and relies on uniformed search order. The goal of this dissertation research is to develop novel techniques that enable heuristic search algorithms to solve problems with real values using a best-first search order while exploiting external memory and multiple processors. This work will be organized into four components. The first component will discuss external memory search and present a novel technique for incorporating real-valued edge costs. The second component will present a novel algorithm for solving problems with large branching factors with application to the challenging problem of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). The third component will cover bounded suboptimal external search for practical MSA applications. The final component of this research will be the development of a novel distributed search framework; allowing parallel and external memory heuristic search algorithms to run cooperatively on a commodity computing cluster. Together these four components will enable heuristic search to scale to large problems in practical settings while exploiting modern hardware.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6144/6803,heuristic search; multiple sequence alignment; distributed; parallel; external memory;
268,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Crowdsourcing for Deployable Intelligent Systems,Walter Stephen Lasecki,"My work aims to create a scaffold for deployable intelligent systems using crowdsourcing. Current approaches in artificial intelligence (AI) typically focus on solving a narrow subset of problems in a given space - for example: automatic speech recognition as part of a conversational assistant, machine vision as part of a question answering service for blind people, or planning as part of a home assistive robot. This approach is necessary to scope the solution, but often results in a large number of systems that are rarely deployed in real-world setting, but instead operate in toy domains, or in situations where other parts of the problem are assumed to be solved. The framework I have developed aims to use the crowd to help in two ways: (i) make it possible to use human intelligence to power parts of a system that automated approaches cannot or do not yet handle, and (ii) provide a means of enabling more effective deployable systems by people to provide reliable training data on-demand. This summary begins with a brief review of prior work, then outlines a number of different system that I have developed to demonstrate the capabilities of this framework, and concludes with future work to be completed as part of my thesis.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6391/6804,"crowdsourcing, human computation, intelligent systems"
269,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Multiagent Stochastic Planning With Bayesian Policy Recognition,Alessandro Panella,"When operating in stochastic, partially observable, multiagent settings, it is crucial to accurately predict the actions of other agents. In my thesis work, I propose methodologies for learning the policy of external agents from their observed behavior, in the form of finite state controllers. To perform this task, I adopt Bayesian learning algorithms based on nonparametric prior distributions, that provide the flexibility required to infer models of unknown complexity. These methods are to be embedded in decision making frameworks for autonomous planning in partially observable multiagent systems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6357/6805,"Multiagent Systems, Stochastic Planning, Bayesian Learning, Nonparametric Bayesian Models, Dirichlet Process"
270,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Efficient Algorithms for Strong Local Consistencies in Constraint Satisfaction Problems,Anastasia Paparrizou,"The existing complete methods for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are usually based on a combination of exhaustive search and constraint propagation techniques for the reduction of the search space. Such propagation techniques are the local consistency algorithms. Arc Consistency (AC) and Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) are the most widely studied local consistencies that are predominantly used in constraint solvers. However, many stronger local consistencies than (G)AC have been proposed, even recently, but have been rather overlooked due to their prohibitive cost. This research proposes efficient algorithms for strong consistencies for both binary and non-binary constraints that can be easily adopted by standard CP solvers. Experimental results have so far demonstrated that the proposed algorithms are quite competitive and often more efficient than state-of-the-art methods, being orders of magnitude faster on various problem classes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6344/6806,Constraint Propagation; Strong Local Consistencies; Table Constraints

It is envisaged that this will be achieved by both finding parallel approaches to algorithms commonly used in robotics, and investigating the use of a scheduler to efficiently allocate resources across a heterogeneous hardware platform. In particular, while there has been much research on using specialized hardware for image and video processing algorithms, work on areas specific to robotics, such as position tracking, mapping and sensor fusion, is not as common.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6231/6807,Robotics; mapping; GPU; parallel; position tracking; SLAM

Bazzan","The combination of distinct algorithms expertise to improve prediction accuracy, inspired by the theory of wisdom of crowds, has been increasingly discussed in literature. However, its application to bioinformatics-related tasks is still in its infancy. This thesis aims at investigating the potential and limitations of ensemble-based solutions for two bioinformatics prediction tasks, namely inference of gene regulatory networks and prediction of microRNAs targets, as well as propose new integration methods.

273,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Concurrent Inference Graphs,Daniel R. Schlegel,"Since their popularity began to rise in the mid-2000s there has been significant growth in the number of multi-core and multi-processor computers available. Knowledge representation systems using logical inference have been slow to embrace this new technology. We present the concept of inference graphs, a natural deduction inference system which scales well on multi-core and multi-processor machines. Inference graphs enhance propositional graphs by treating propositional nodes as tasks which can be scheduled to operate upon messages sent between nodes via the arcs that already exist as part of the propositional graph representation. The use of scheduling heuristics within a prioritized message passing architecture allows inference graphs to perform very well in forward, backward, bi-directional, and focused reasoning. Tests demonstrate the usefulness of our scheduling heuristics, and show significant speedup in both best case and worst case inference scenarios as the number of processors increases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6260/6809,Automated Inference; Inference Graphs; SNePS
274,2013,AAAI-SIGART Doctoral Consortium,Multi-Strategy Learning of Robotic Behaviours via Qualitative Reasoning,Timothy Wiley,"When given a task, an autonomous agent must plan a series of actions to perform in order to complete the goal. In robotics, planners face additional challenges as the domain is typically large (even infinite) continuous, noisy, and non- deterministic. Typically stochastic planning has been used to solve robotic control tasks. Such planners have been very successful in their various domains. The downside to such approaches is that the models and planners are highly specialised to a single control task. To change the control task, requires developing an entirely new planner. The research in my thesis focuses on the problem of specialisation in continuous, noisy and non-deterministic robotic domains by developing a more generic planner. It builds on previous research in the area, specifically using the technique of Multi-Strategy Learning. Qualitative Modelling and Qualitative Reasoning is used to provide the generality, from which specific, Quantitative controllers can be quickly learnt. The resulting system is applied to a real world robotic platform for rough terrain navigation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6309/6810,Machine Learning;Robotics;Qualitative Modelling and Reasoning

In many practical applications involving product configuration or planning, it is often the case that there are many valid solutions. To help the user see a small but representative sample, one needs algorithms that compute sets of dissimilar solutions. Once the user ""zooms"" in on one or two that she likes the most, it still makes sense to present several alternatives that are similar to the selected ones so that the user can find one that truly corresponds to her needs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6282/6812,
