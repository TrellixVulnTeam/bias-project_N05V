0,2015,AI and the Web,Efficient Top-k Shortest-Path Distance Queries on Large Networks by Pruned Landmark Labeling,"Takuya Akiba, Takanori Hayashi, Nozomi Nori, Yoichi Iwata, Yuichi Yoshida","We propose an indexing scheme for top-k shortest-path distance queries on graphs, which is useful in a wide range of important applications such as network-aware search and link prediction. While considerable effort has been made for efficiently answering standard (top-1) distance queries, none of previous methods can be directly extended for top-k distance queries. We propose a new framework for top-k distance queries based on 2-hop cover and then present an efficient indexing algorithm based on the simple but effective recent notion of pruned landmark labeling. Extensive experimental results on real social and web graphs show the scalability, efficiency and robustness of our method. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of top-k distance queries through an application to link prediction.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9320/9217,graphs; social networks; web graphs; shortest-path distance; node similarity measure; link prediction
1,2015,AI and the Web,Inferring Same-As Facts from Linked Data: An Iterative Import-by-Query Approach,"Mustafa Al-Bakri, Manuel Atencia, Steffen Lalande, Marie-Christine Rousset",In this paper we model the problem of data linkage in Linked Data as a reasoning problem on possibly decentralized data. We describe a novel import-by-query algorithm that alternates steps of sub-query rewriting and of tailored querying the Linked Data cloud in order to import data as specific as possible for inferring or contradicting given target same-as facts. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and its usefulness in practice for data linkage and disambiguation.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9508/9218,Linked Open Data data linkage forward and backward reasoning Datalog rules external queries
2,2015,AI and the Web,A Personalized Interest-Forgetting Markov Model for Recommendations,"Jun Chen, Chaokun Wang, Jianmin Wang","Intelligent item recommendation is a key issue in AI research which enables recommender systems to be more “human-minded” when generating recommendations. However, one of the major features of human — forgetting, has barely been discussed as regards recommender systems. In this paper, we considered people’s forgetting of interest when performing personalized recommendations, and brought forward a personalized framework to integrate interest-forgetting property with Markov model. Multiple implementations of the framework were investigated and compared. The experimental evaluation showed that our methods could significantly improve the accuracy of item recommendation, which verified the importance of considering interest-forgetting in recommendations.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9387/9219,IFMM; Interest-Forgetting; Markov Model; Personalized Recommendation; Interest Retention
3,2015,AI and the Web,"Will You ""Reconsume"" the Near Past? Fast Prediction on Short-Term Reconsumption Behaviors","Jun Chen, Chaokun Wang, Jianmin Wang","The short-term reconsumption behaviors, i.e. “reconsume” the near past, account for a large proportion of people’s activities every day and everywhere. In this paper, we firstly derived four generic features which influence people’s short-term reconsumption behaviors. These features were extracted with respect to different roles in the process of reconsumption behaviors, i.e. users, items and interactions. Then, we brought forward two fast algorithms with the linear and the quadratic kernels to predict whether a user will perform a short-term reconsumption at a specific time given the context. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms are more accurate in the prediction tasks compared with the baselines. Meanwhile, the time complexity of online prediction of our algorithms is O(1), which enables fast prediction in real-world scenarios. The prediction contributes to more intelligent decision-making, e.g. potential revisited customer identification, personalized recommendation, and information re-finding.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9491/9220,STREC; Reconsumption Behaviors; Prediction Algorithms; Feature Extraction; Web User Analysis
4,2015,AI and the Web,VELDA: Relating an Image Tweet’s Text and Images,"Tao Chen, Hany M. SalahEldeen, Xiangnan He, Min-Yen Kan, Dongyuan Lu","Image tweets are becoming a prevalent form of socialmedia, but little is known about their content — textualand visual — and the relationship between the two mediums.Our analysis of image tweets shows that while visualelements certainly play a large role in image-text relationships, other factors such as emotional elements, also factor into the relationship. We develop Visual-Emotional LDA (VELDA), a novel topic model to capturethe image-text correlation from multiple perspectives (namely, visual and emotional). Experiments on real-world image tweets in both Englishand Chinese and other user generated content, show that VELDA significantly outperforms existingmethods on cross-modality image retrieval. Even in other domains where emotion does not factor in imagechoice directly, our VELDA model demonstrates good generalization ability, achieving higher fidelity modeling of such multimedia documents.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9445/9221,image tweets; microblog; image and text; topic model
5,2015,AI and the Web,On Information Coverage for Location Category Based Point-of-Interest Recommendation,"Xuefeng Chen, Yifeng Zeng, Gao Cong, Shengchao Qin, Yanping Xiang, Yuanshun Dai","Point-of-interest(POI) recommendation becomes a valuable service in  location-based social networks. Based on the norm that similar users are likely to have similar preference of POIs, the current recommendation techniques mainly focus on users' preference to provide accurate recommendation results. This tends to generate a list of homogeneous POIs that are clustered into a narrow band of location categories(like food, museum, etc.) in a city. However, users are more interested to taste a wide range of flavors that are exposed in a global set of location categories in the city.In this paper, we  formulate a new POI recommendation problem, namely top-K location category based POI recommendation, by introducing information coverage to encode the location categories of POIs in a city.The problem is NP-hard. We develop a greedy algorithm and further optimization to solve this challenging problem. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of new POI recommendations and the superior  performance of the proposed algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9703/9222,Recommendation;Social Networks
6,2015,AI and the Web,Visually Interpreting Names as Demographic Attributes by Exploiting Click-Through Data,"Yan-Ying Chen, Yin-Hsi Kuo, Chun-Che Wu, Winston H. Hsu","Name of an identity is strongly influenced by his/her cultural background such as gender and ethnicity, both vital attributes for user profiling, attribute-based retrieval, etc. Typically, the associations between names and attributes (e.g., people named ""Amy"" are mostly females) are annotated manually or provided by the census data of governments. We propose to associate a name and its likely demographic attributes by exploiting click-throughs between name queries and images with automatically detected facial attributes. This is the first work attempting to translate an abstract name to demographic attributes in visual-data-driven manner, and it is adaptive to incremental data, more countries and even unseen names (the names out of click-through data) without additional manual labels. In the experiments, the automatic name-attribute associations can help gender inference with competitive accuracy by using manual labeling. It also benefits profiling social media users and keyword-based face image retrieval, especially for contributing 12% relative improvement of accuracy in adapting to unseen names.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9633/9223,Click-Through Data; Name Attributes; Image Retrieval; User Profiling
7,2015,AI and the Web,A New Granger Causal Model for Influence Evolution in Dynamic Social Networks: The Case of DBLP,"Belkacem Chikhaoui, Mauricio Chiazzaro, Shengrui Wang","This paper addresses a new problem concerning the evolution of influence relationships between communities in dynamic social networks. A weighted temporal multigraph is employed to represent the dynamics of the social networks and analyze the influence relationships between communities over time. To ensure the interpretability of the knowledge discovered, evolution of the influence relationships is assessed by introducing the Granger causality. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate the suitability of our model for studying the evolution of influence between communities. Moreover, we empirically show how our model is able to accurately predict the influence of communities over time using random forest regression.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9381/9224,Granger causality; Influence evolution; Dynamic social networks; Influence prediction; Multigraphs; Random forests
8,2015,AI and the Web,An Axiomatic Approach to Link Prediction,"Sara Cohen, Aviv Zohar","Link prediction functions are important tools that are used to predict the evolution of a network, to locate hidden or surprising links, and to recommend new connections that should be formed.  Multiple link prediction functions have been developed in the past. However, their evaluation has mostly been based onexperimental work, which has shown that the quality of a link prediction function varies significantly depending on the input domain. There is currently very little understanding of why and how a specific link prediction function works well for a particular domain. The underlying foundations of a link prediction function are often left informal---each function contains implicit assumptions about the dynamics of link formation, and about structural properties that result from these dynamics. We draw upon the motivation used in characterizations of ranking algorithms, as well as other celebrated results from social choice, and present an axiomatic basis for link prediction. This approach seeks to deconstruct each function into basic axioms, or properties, that make explicit its underlying assumptions. Our framework uses ``property templates'' that can be considered as general choices made by a function designer, such as what score is assigned to a 2-vertex graph, which vertices are irrelevant to the score, how removing edges or contracting vertices affects the score, and more.  Using this framework, we fully characterize four well known link prediction functions and show that they are in fact derived from different variants of a single basic set of property templates.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9664/9225,Link prediction; Axiomatic approach
9,2015,AI and the Web,Perceiving Group Themes from Collective Social and Behavioral Information,"Peng Cui, Tianyang Zhang, Fei Wang, Peng He","Collective social and behavioral information commonly exists in nature. There is a widespread intuitive sense that the characteristics of these social and behavioral information are to some extend related to the themes (or semantics) of the activities or targets. In this paper, we explicitly validate the interplay of collective social behavioral information and group themes using a large scale real dataset of online groups, and demonstrate the possibility of perceiving group themes from collective social and behavioral information. We propose a REgularized miXEd Regression (REXER) model based on matrix factorization to infer hierarchical semantics (including both group category and group labels) from collective social and behavioral information of group members. We extensively evaluate the proposed method in a large scale real online group dataset. For the prediction of group themes, the proposed REXER achieves satisfactory performances in various criterions. More specifically, we can predict the category of a group (among 6 categories) purely based on the collective social and behavioral information of the group with the Precision@1 to be 55.16% , without any assistance from group labels or conversation contents. We also show, perhaps counterintuitively, that the collective social and behavioral information is more reliable than the titles and labels of groups for inferring the group categories.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9483/9226,
10,2015,AI and the Web,Predicting the Demographics of Twitter Users from Website Traffic Data,"Aron Culotta, Nirmal Ravi Kumar, Jennifer Cutler","Understanding the demographics of users of online social networks has important applications for health, marketing, and public messaging. In this paper, we predict the demographics of Twitter users based on whom they follow. Whereas most prior approaches rely on a supervised learning approach, in which individual users are labeled with demographics, we instead create a distantly labeled dataset by collecting audience measurement data for 1,500 websites (e.g., 50% of visitors to gizmodo.com are estimated to have a bachelor's degree). We then fit a regression model to predict these demographics using information about the followers of each website on Twitter. The resulting average held-out correlation is .77 across six different variables (gender, age, ethnicity, education, income, and child status). We additionally validate the model on a smaller set of Twitter users labeled individually for ethnicity and gender, finding performance that is surprisingly competitive with a fully supervised approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9945/9227,"social media, demographics, regression"
11,2015,AI and the Web,High-Performance Distributed ML at Scale through Parameter Server Consistency Models,"Wei Dai, Abhimanu Kumar, Jinliang Wei, Qirong Ho, Garth Gibson, Eric P. Xing","As Machine Learning (ML) applications embrace greater data size and model complexity, practitioners turn to distributed clusters to satisfy the increased computational and memory demands. Effective use of clusters for ML programs requires considerable expertise in writing distributed code, but existing highly-abstracted frameworks  like Hadoop that pose low barriers to distributed-programming have not, in practice, matched the performance seen in highly specialized and advanced ML implementations. The recent Parameter Server (PS) paradigm is a middle ground between these extremes, allowing easy conversion of single-machine parallel ML programs into distributed ones, while maintaining high throughput through relaxed ``consistency models"" that allow asynchronous (and, hence, inconsistent) parameter reads. However, due to insufficient theoretical study, it is not clear which of these consistency models can really ensure correct ML algorithm output; at the same time, there remain many theoretically-motivated but undiscovered opportunities to maximize computational throughput. Inspired by this challenge, we study both the theoretical guarantees and empirical behavior of iterative-convergent ML algorithms in existing PS consistency models. We then use the gleaned insights to improve a consistency model using an ""eager"" PS communication mechanism, and implement it as a new PS system that enables ML programs to reach their solution more quickly.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9786/9228,"Large-scale ML, Parameter Server, Distributed Stochastic Optimization, Probability Bounds, Semi-Synchronous Systems"
12,2015,AI and the Web,An EBMC-Based Approach to Selecting Types for Entity Filtering,"Jiwei Ding, Wentao Ding, Wei Hu, Yuzhong Qu","The quantity of entities in the Linked Data is increasing rapidly. For entity search and browsing systems, filtering is very useful for users to find entities that they are interested in. Type is a kind of widely-used facet and can be easily obtained from knowledge bases, which enables to create filters by selecting at most K types of an entity collection. However, existing approaches often fail to select high-quality type filters due to complex overlap between types. In this paper, we propose a novel type selection approach based upon Budgeted Maximum Coverage (BMC), which can achieve integral optimization for the coverage quality of type filters. Furthermore, we define a new optimization problem called Extended Budgeted Maximum Coverage (EBMC) and propose an EBMC-based approach, which enhances the BMC-based approach by incorporating the relevance between entities and types, so as to create sensible type filters. Our experimental results show that the EBMC-based approach performs best comparing with several representative approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9808/9229,Budgeted Maximum Coverage; Type Filter; Type Hierarchy
13,2015,AI and the Web,Trust Models for RDF Data: Semantics and Complexity,"Valeria Fionda, Gianluigi Greco","Due to the openness and decentralization of the Web, mechanisms to represent and reason about the reliability of RDF data become essential. This paper embarks on a formal analysis of RDF data enriched with trust information by focusing on the characterization of its model-theoretic semantics and on the study of relevant reasoning problems. The impact of trust values on the computational complexity of well-known concepts related to the entailment of RDF graphs is studied. In particular, islands of tractability are identified for classes of acyclic and nearly-acyclic graphs. Moreover, an implementation of the framework and an experimental evaluation on real data are discussed.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9453/9230,RDF reasoning; entailment; trust; islands of tractability

EPPs allow to capture in a succinct way a larger class of navigational queries than property paths. We present the syntax and formal semantics of EPPs and introduce two different evaluation strategies. The first is based on an algorithm implemented in a custom query processor. The second strategy leverages a translation algorithm of EPPs into SPARQL queries that can be executed on existing SPARQL processors. We compare the two evaluation strategies on real data to highlight their pros and cons.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9661/9231,Graph Navigational Languages; Property Paths; Translation into SPARQL; RDF
15,2015,AI and the Web,Lower and Upper Bounds for SPARQL Queries over OWL Ontologies,"Birte Glimm, Yevgeny Kazakov, Ilianna Kollia, Giorgos Stamou","The paper presents an approach for optimizing the evaluation of  SPARQL queries over OWL ontologies using SPARQL's OWL Direct Semantics entailment  regime. The approach is based on the computation of lower and upper  bounds, but we allow for much more expressive queries than related  approaches. In order to optimize the evaluation of possible query answers in  the upper but not in the lower bound, we present a query extension  approach that uses schema knowledge from the queried ontology to  extend the query with additional parts. We show that the resulting  query is equivalent to the original one and we use the additional  parts that are simple to evaluate for restricting the bounds of subqueries of the initial query.  In an empirical evaluation we show that the  proposed query extension approach can lead to a significant decrease  in the query execution time of up to four orders of magnitude.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9715/9232,SPARQL Queries; Query Bounds; Query Extension; Query Answering; OWL Ontologies

Creating summaries on lengthy Semantic Web documents for quick identification of the corresponding entity has been of great contemporary interest. In this paper, we explore automatic summarization techniques that characterize and enable identification of an entity and create summaries that are human friendly. Specifically, we highlight the importance of diversified (faceted) summaries by combining three dimensions: diversity, uniqueness, and popularity. Our novel diversity-aware entity summarization approach mimics human conceptual clustering techniques to group facts and picks representative facts from each group to form concise (i.e., short) and comprehensive (i.e., improved coverage through diversity) summaries. We evaluate our approach against the state-of-the-art techniques and show that our work improves both the quality and the efficiency of entity summarization.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9562/9233,Entity summary; Hierarchical conceptual clustering; Ranking; RDF; DBpedia
17,2015,AI and the Web,TrustSVD: Collaborative Filtering with Both the Explicit and Implicit Influence of User Trust and of Item Ratings,"Guibing Guo, Jie Zhang, Neil Yorke-Smith","Collaborative filtering suffers from the problems of data sparsity and cold start, which dramatically degrade recommendation performance.  To help resolve these issues, we propose TrustSVD, a trust-based matrix factorization technique. By analyzing the social trust data from four real-world data sets, we conclude that not only the explicit but also the implicit influence of both ratings and trust should be taken into consideration in a recommendation model.  Hence, we build on top of a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm SVD++ which inherently involves the explicit and implicit influence of rated items, by further incorporating both the explicit and implicit influence of trusted users on the prediction of items for an active user. To our knowledge, the work reported is the first to extend SVD++ with social trust information.  Experimental results on the four data sets demonstrate that our approach TrustSVD achieves better accuracy than other ten counterparts, and can better handle the concerned issues.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9313/9234,Recommender systems; social trust; trust influence
18,2015,AI and the Web,A Stochastic Model for Detecting Heterogeneous Link Communities in Complex Networks,"Dongxiao He, Dayou Liu, Di Jin, Weixiong Zhang","Discovery of communities in networks is a fundamental data analysis problem. Most of the existing approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, while recent studies have shown great advantages and utilities of the knowledge of communities of links. Stochastic models provides a promising class of techniques for the identification of modular structures, but most stochastic models mainly focus on the detection of node communities rather than link communities. We propose a stochastic model, which not only describes the structure of link communities, but also considers the heterogeneous distribution of community sizes, a property which is often ignored by other models. We then learn the model parameters using a method of maximum likelihood based on an expectation-maximization algorithm. To deal with large complex real networks, we extend the method by a strategy of iterative bipartition. The extended method is not only efficient, but is also able to determine the number of communities for a given network. We test our approach on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks including an application to a large biological network, and also compare it with two existing methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the competing methods for detecting link communities.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9372/9235,"Complex Network, Community Structure, Stochastic Model, Expectation-Maximization"
19,2015,AI and the Web,Prajna: Towards Recognizing Whatever You Want from Images without Image Labeling,"Xian-Sheng Hua, Jin Li","With the advances in distributed computation, machine learn-ing and deep neural networks, we enter into an era that it is possible to build a real world image recognition system. There are three essential components to build a real-world image recognition system: 1) creating representative features, 2) de-signing powerful learning approaches, and 3) identifying massive training data. While extensive researches have been done on the first two aspects, much less attention has been paid on the third. In this paper, we present an end-to-end Web knowledge discovery system, Prajna. Starting from an arbi-trary set of entities as inputs, Prajna automatically crawls im-ages from multiple sources, identifies images that have relia-bly labeled, trains models and build a recognition system that is capable of recognizing any new images of the entity set. Due to the high cost of manual data labeling, leveraging the massive yet noisy data on the Internet is a natural idea, but the practical engineering aspect is highly challenging. Prajna fo-cuses on separating reliable training data from extensive noisy data, which is a key to the capability of extending an image recognition system to support arbitrary entities. In this paper, we will analyze the intrinsic characteristics of Internet image data, and find ways to mine accurate and informative infor-mation from those data to build a training set, which is then used to train image recognition models. Prajna is capable of automatically building an image recognition system for those entities as long as we can collect sufficient number of images of the entities on the Web.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9646/9236,

Predicting document location of origin based on text content on a geodesic grid is computationally attractive since many standard methods for supervised document classification carry over unchanged to geolocation in the form of predicting a most probable grid cell for a document.  However, the grid-based approach suffers from sparse data problems if one wants to improve classification accuracy by moving to smaller cell sizes.  In this paper we investigate an enhancement of common methods for determining the geographic point of origin of a text document by kernel density estimation.  For geolocation of tweets we obtain a  improvements upon non-kernel methods on datasets of U.S. and global Twitter content.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/10034/9237,document geolocation; twitter; kernel classifier

It can be treated as a bi-media multimodal mapping problem and modeled as a correlation distribution over multimodal feature representations. It integrates the multimodal feature generation with the Locality Linear Coding (LLC) and co-occurrence association network, multimodal feature fusion with CCA, and accelerated hierarchical k-means clustering, which aims to characterize the correlations between the inter-related visual features in images and semantic features in captions, and measure their association degree more precisely.

Although being promising for identifying network communities, the popular stochastic models often do not preserve node degrees, thus reducing their representation power and applicability to real-world networks. Here we address this critical problem. Instead of using a blockmodel, we adopted a random-graph null model to faithfully capture community structures by preserving in the model the expected node degrees. The new model, learned using nonnegative matrix factorization, is more accurate and robust in representing community structures than the existing methods.

This makes them useful tools for ontology analysis, ontology evolution and information hiding. Most previous research focused on uniform interpolation of TBoxes. However, especially for applications in privacy and information hiding, it is essential that uniform interpolation methods can deal with ABoxes as well. We present the first method that can compute uniform interpolants of any ALC ontology with ABoxes. ABoxes bring their own challenges when computing uniform interpolants, possibly requiring disjunctive statements or nominals in the resulting ABox. Our method can compute representations of uniform interpolants in ALCO.

25,2015,AI and the Web,Using Matched Samples to Estimate the Effects of Exercise on Mental Health via Twitter,"Virgile Landeiro Dos Reis, Aron Culotta","Recent work has demonstrated the value of social media monitoring for health surveillance (e.g., tracking influenza or depression rates). It is an open question whether such data can be used to make causal inferences (e.g., determining which activities lead to increased depression rates). Even in traditional, restricted domains, estimating causal effects from observational data is highly susceptible to confounding bias. In this work, we estimate the effect of exercise on mental health from Twitter, relying on statistical matching methods to reduce confounding bias. We train a text classifier to estimate the volume of a user's tweets expressing anxiety, depression, or anger, then compare two groups: those who exercise regularly (identified by their use of physical activity trackers like Nike+), and a matched control group. We find that those who exercise regularly have significantly fewer tweets expressing depression or anxiety; there is no significant difference in rates of tweets expressing anger. We additionally perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate how the many experimental design choices in such a study impact the final conclusions, including the quality of the classifier and the construction of the control group.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9960/9242,"social media, public health"

In real world applications when data is dynamic and incomplete, especially those exposed by sensors, reasoning is limited by dynamics of data while learning is biased by data incompleteness. Therefore discovering consistent knowledge from incomplete and dynamic data is a challenging open problem. In our approach the semantics of data is captured through ontologies to empower learning (mining) with (Description Logics) reasoning.

Three requisite properties  is proposed to form an ideal reconstructable summary: Coverage, Sparsity and Diversity. We then formalize the task of multi-document summarization as an optimization problem according to the above properties, and use simulated annealing algorithm to solve it.Extensive experiments on summarization benchmark data sets DUC2006 and DUC2007 show that our proposed model is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9375/9244,summarization; sparse coding
28,2015,AI and the Web,COT: Contextual Operating Tensor for Context-Aware Recommender Systems,"Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","With rapid growth of information on the internet, recommender systems become fundamental for helping users alleviate the problem of information overload. Since contextual information can be used as a significant factor in modeling user behavior, various context-aware recommendation methods are proposed. However, the state-of-the-art context modeling methods treat contexts as other dimensions similar to the dimensions of users and items, and cannot capture the special semantic operation of contexts. On the other hand, some works on multi-domain relation prediction can be used for the context-aware recommendation, but they have problems in generating recommendation under a large amount of contextual information. In this work, we propose Contextual Operating Tensor (COT) model, which represents the common semantic effects of contexts as a contextual operating tensor and represents a context as a latent vector. Then, to model the semantic operation of a context combination, we generate contextual operating matrix from the contextual operating tensor and latent vectors of contexts.

Tsang","Effective forecasting of future prevalent topics plays animportant role in social network business development.It involves two challenging aspects: predicting whethera topic will become prevalent, and when. This cannotbe directly handled by the existing algorithms in topicmodeling, item recommendation and action forecasting.The classic forecasting framework based on time seriesmodels may be able to predict a hot topic when a seriesof periodical changes to user-addressed frequency in asystematic way. However, the frequency of topics discussedby users often changes irregularly in social networks.In this paper, a generic probabilistic frameworkis proposed for hot topic prediction, and machine learningmethods are explored to predict hot topic patterns.Two effective models, PreWHether and PreWHen, areintroduced to predict whether and when a topic will becomeprevalent. In the PreWHether model, we simulatethe constructed features of previously observed frequencychanges for better prediction.

30,2015,AI and the Web,Content-Based Collaborative Filtering for News Topic Recommendation,"Zhongqi Lu, Zhicheng Dou, Jianxun Lian, Xing Xie, Qiang Yang","News recommendation has become a big attraction with which major Web search portals retain their users. Two effective approaches are Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering, each serving a specific recommendation scenario. The Content-based Filtering approaches inspect rich contexts of the recommended items, while the Collaborative Filtering approaches predict the interests of long-tail users by collaboratively learning from interests of related users. We have observed empirically that, for the problem of news topic displaying, both the rich context of news topics and the long-tail users exist. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Content-based Collaborative Filtering approach (CCF) to bring both Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering approaches together. We found that combining the two is not an easy task, but the benefits of CCF are impressive. On one hand, CCF makes recommendations based on the rich contexts of the news. On the other hand, CCF collaboratively analyzes the scarce feedbacks from the long-tail users. We tailored this CCF approach for the news topic displaying on the Bing front page and demonstrated great gains in attracting users.

31,2015,AI and the Web,A Tri-Role Topic Model for Domain-Specific Question Answering,"Zongyang Ma, Aixin Sun, Quan Yuan, Gao Cong","Stack Overflow and MedHelp are examples of domain-specific community-based question answering (CQA) systems. Different from CQA systems for general topics (e.g., Yahoo! Answers, Baidu Knows), questions and answers in domain-specific CQA systems are mostly in the same topical domain, enabling more comprehensive interaction between users on fine-grained topics. In such systems, users are more likely to ask questions on unfamiliar topics and to answer questions matching their expertise. Users can also vote answers based on their judgements. In this paper, we propose a Tri-Role Topic Model (TRTM) to model the tri-roles of users (i.e., as askers, answerers, and voters, respectively) and the activities of each role including composing question, selecting question to answer, contributing and voting answers. The proposed model can be used to enhance CQA systems from many perspectives. As a case study, we conducted experiments on ranking answers for questions on Stack Overflow, a CQA system for professional and enthusiast programmers. Experimental results show that TRTM is effective in facilitating users getting ideal rankings of answers, particularly for new and less popular questions.

33,2015,AI and the Web,Incorporating Assortativity and Degree Dependence into Scalable Network Models,"Stephen Mussmann, John Moore, Joseph John Pfeiffer, Jennifer Neville","Due to the recent availability of large complex networks, considerable analysis has focused on understanding and characterizing the properties of these networks.  Scalable generative graph models focus on modeling distributions of graphs that match real world network properties and scale to large datasets.  Much work has focused on modeling networks with a power law degree distribution, clustering, and small diameter. In network analysis, the assortativity statistic is defined as the correlation between the degrees of linked nodes in the network. The assortativity measure can distinguish between types of networks---social networks commonly exhibit positive assortativity, in contrast to biological or technological networks that are typically disassortative.  Despite this, little work has focused on scalable graph models that capture assortativity in networks. The contributions of our work are twofold.  First, we prove that an unbounded number of pairs of networks exist with the same degree distribution and assortativity, yet different joint degree distributions.  Thus, assortativity as a network measure cannot distinguish between graphs with complex (non-linear) dependence in their joint degree distributions.  Motivated by this finding, we introduce a generative graph model that explicitly estimates and models the joint degree distribution.  Our Binned Chung Lu method accurately captures both the joint degree distribution and assortativity, while still matching characteristics such as the degree distribution and clustering coefficients.  Further, our method has subquadratic learning and sampling methods that enable scaling to large, real world networks. We evaluate performance compared to other scalable graph models on six real world networks, including a citation network with over 14 million edges.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9999/9250,Generative Graph Models; Social Network Analysis

HACC utilizes a classifier as a preprocessing step in order to integrate all known information into one similarity measure and then uses a clustering algorithm to identify missing nodes. Specifically, we used the information on the network structure, attributes about known users (nodes) and pictorial information to evaluate HACC and found that it performs significantly better than other missing node algorithms.

Various causal inference methods have been employed to measure the causal effects of ad treatments. However, existing methods mainly focus on linear logistic regression for univariate and binary treatments and are not well suited for complex ad treatments of multi-dimensions, where each dimension could be discrete or continuous. In this paper we propose a novel two-stage causal inference framework for assessing the impact of complex ad treatments. In the first stage, we estimate the propensity parameter via a sparse additive model; in the second stage, a propensity-adjusted regression model is applied for measuring the treatment effect. Our approach is shown to provide an unbiased estimation of the ad effectiveness under regularity conditions. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to a real online advertising campaign to evaluate the impact of three ad treatments: ad frequency, ad channel, and ad size.

Analyzing such user-generated content has recently attracted research interest. However, in multilingual societies such as India, analyzing such user-generated content is hard due to several reasons: (1) There are more than 20 official languages but linguistic resources are available mainly for Hindi. It is observed that people frequently use romanized text as it is easy and quick using an English keyboard, resulting in multi-glyphic comments, where the texts are in the same language but in different scripts. Such romanized texts are almost unexplored in machine learning so far. (2) In many cases, comments are made on a specific part of the article rather than the topic of the entire article. Off-the-shelf methods such as correspondence LDA are insufficient to model such relationships between articles and comments.

Although the cascade volume prediction has been extensively studied, how to predict when a burst will come remains an open problem. It is challenging to predict the time of the burst due to the ``quick rise and fall'' pattern and the diverse time spans of the cascades. To this end, this paper proposes a classification based approach for burst time prediction by utilizing and modeling rich knowledge in information diffusion. Particularly, we first propose a time window based approach to predict in which time window the burst will appear. This paves the way to transform the time prediction task to a classification problem. To address the challenge that the original time series data of the cascade popularity only are not sufficient for predicting cascades with diverse magnitudes and time spans, we explore rich information diffusion related knowledge and model them in a scale-independent manner.

To obtain an accurate multiple-independent-Bernoulli-distribution model of the topological feature space, our approach adjusts the sampling of the adjacency matrix of the network (or graph) using the clustering information in the node feature space.

To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework which incorporates ``bag-of-words'' type meta-data on items into pair-wise ranking models for one-class collaborative filtering. The main idea of our method lies in extending the pair-wise ranking with a probabilistic topic modeling. Instead of regularizing item factors through a zero-mean Gaussian prior, our method introduces item-specific topic proportions  as priors for item factors.

Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images.  To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network.

This observation motivates us to consider a feature-centric recommendation approach to item recommendation: instead of directly predicting the rating on items, we predict the rating on the features of items, and use such ratings to derive the rating on an item. This approach offers several advantages over the traditional item-centric approach: it incorporates more information about why a user chooses an item, it generalizes better due to the denser feature rating data, it explains the prediction of item ratings through the predicted feature ratings. Another contribution is turning a principled item-centric solution into a feature-centric solution, instead of inventing a new algorithm that is feature-centric.

Recently, overlapping community detection becomes a trend due to the ubiquity of overlapping and nested communities in real world. However, existing approaches have ignored the use of implicit link preference information, i.e., links can reflect a node's preference on the targets of connections it wants to build. This information has strong impact on community detection since a node prefers to build links with nodes inside its community than those outside its community. In this paper, we propose a preference-based nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF) model to incorporate implicit link preference information. Unlike conventional matrix factorization approaches, which simply approximate the original adjacency matrix in value, our model maximizes the likelihood of the preference order for each node by following the intuition that a node prefers its neighbors than other nodes. Our model overcomes the indiscriminate penalty problem in which non-linked pairs inside one community are equally penalized in objective functions as those across two communities. We propose a learning algorithm which can learn a node-community membership matrix via stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We evaluate our PNMF model on several real-world networks.

Due to the increasing requirements, in recent years, the task has attracted extensive attentions. In this work,  we propose a novel method using non-parametric statistical models to combine structural, textual, and temporal information together to predict retweet behavior. To evaluate the proposed method, we  collect a large number of microblogs and their corresponding social networks from a real microblog service.

One of the main difficulties lies in the word mismatch between queries and candidate questions. Existing solutions try to expand the queries at word level, but they usually fail to consider concept level enrichment. In this paper, we explore a pivot language translation based approach to derive the paraphrases of key concepts.

58,2015,AI and the Web,Representation Learning for Aspect Category Detection in Online Reviews,"Xinjie Zhou, Xiaojun Wan, Jianguo Xiao","User-generated reviews are valuable resources for decision making. Identifying the aspect categories discussed in a given review sentence (e.g., “food” and “service” in restaurant reviews) is an important task of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Given a predefined aspect category set, most previous researches leverage hand-crafted features and a classification algorithm to accomplish the task. The crucial step to achieve better performance is feature engineering which consumes much human effort and may be unstable when the product domain changes. In this paper, we propose a representation learning approach to automatically learn useful features for aspect category detection. Specifically, a semi-supervised word embedding algorithm is first proposed to obtain continuous word representations on a large set of reviews with noisy labels. Afterwards, we propose to generate deeper and hybrid features through neural networks stacked on the word vectors. A logistic regression classifier is finally trained with the hybrid features to predict the aspect category. The experiments are carried out on a benchmark dataset released by SemEval-2014. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the best participating team as well as a few strong baselines.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9764/9275,aspect category detection; opinion mining; representation learning

The learned multi-task GP (MTGP) hyperparameters are then used to assess and forecast patient acuity. Experiments were conducted with two real clinical data sets acquired from ICU patients: firstly, estimating cerebrovascular pressure reactivity, an important indicator of secondary damage for traumatic brain injury patients, by learning the interactions between intracranial pressure and mean arterial blood pressure signals, and secondly, mortality prediction using clinical progress notes. In both cases, MTGPs provided improved results: an MTGP model provided better results than single-task GP models for signal interpolation and forecasting (0.91 vs 0.69 RMSE), and the use of MTGP hyperparameters obtained improved results when used as additional classification features (0.812 vs 0.788 AUC).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9393/9279,Multivariate timeseries modeling; Modeling of sparse and heterogeneous data; clinical data modeling; severity of illness assessment; Multi-task Guassian Process

Most existing MOOC platforms use simple schemes for aggregating peer grades, e.g., taking the median or mean. To enhance these schemes, some recent research attempts have developed machine learning methods under either the cardinal setting (for absolute judgment) or the ordinal setting (for relative judgment). In this paper, we seek to study both cardinal and ordinal aspects of peer grading within a common framework. First, we propose novel extensions to some existing probabilistic graphical models for cardi- nal peer grading. Not only do these extensions give su- perior performance in cardinal evaluation, but they also outperform conventional ordinal models in ordinal eval- uation. Next, we combine cardinal and ordinal models by augmenting ordinal models with cardinal predictions as prior. Such combination can achieve further performance boosts in both cardinal and ordinal evaluations, suggesting a new research direction to pursue for peer grading on MOOCs.

The model assumes the agents have some cognitive capacities for invention, adoption, repair, induction and adaptation, a common vocabulary for basic categories, and the ability to construct complex concepts using recursive combinations of basic categories with logical categories. It also supposes the agents initially do not have a vocabulary for logical categories (i.e. logical connectives), nor grammatical constructions for expressing logical combinations of basic categories through language. The results of the experiments we have performed show that a language system for the expression of logical combinations emerges as a result of a process of self-organisation of the agents' linguistic interactions. Such a language system is concise, because it only uses words and grammatical constructions for three logical categories (i.e. and, or, not). It is also expressive, since it allows the communication of logical combinations of categories of the same complexity as propositional logic formulas, using linguistic devices such as syntactic categories, word order and auxiliary words. Furthermore, it is easy to learn and reliably transmitted across generations, according to the results of our experiments.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9348/9285,Cognitive Modeling; Symbolic AI; Simulating Humans; Logic; Language Acquisition; Adaptive Behavior

Most of knowledge-learning techniques are focused on single modal representations in a static environment with a fixed set of data. Here, we explore an ecologically more-plausible setting by using a stream of cartoon videos to build vision-language concept hierarchies continuously. This approach is motivated by the literature on cognitive development in early childhood. We present the model of deep concept hierarchy (DCH) that enables the progressive abstraction of concept knowledge in multiple levels. We develop a stochastic method for graph construction, i.e. a graph Monte Carlo algorithm, to search efficiently the huge compositional space of the vision-language concepts. The concept hierarchies are built incrementally and can handle concept drift, allowing for being deployed in lifelong learning environments. Using a series of approximately 200 episodes of educational cartoon videos we demonstrate the emergence and evolution of the concept hierarchies as the video stories unfold.

73,2015,Cognitive Systems,Bayesian Affect Control Theory of Self,"Jesse Hoey, Tobias Schroeder","Notions of identity and of the self have long been studied in social psychology and sociology as key guiding elements of social interaction and coordination. In the AI of the future, these notions will also play a role in producing natural, socially appropriate artificially intelligent agents that encompass subtle and complex human social and affective skills. We propose here a Bayesian generalization of the sociological affect control theory of self as a theoretical foundation for socio-affectively skilled artificial agents. This theory posits that each human maintains an internal model of his or her deep sense of ""self"" that captures their emotional, psychological, and socio-cultural sense of being in the world. The ""self"" is then externalised as an identity within any given interpersonal and institutional situation, and this situational identity is the person's local (in space and time) representation of the self. Situational identities govern the actions of humans according to affect control theory. Humans will seek situations that allow them to enact identities consistent with their sense of self. This consistency is cumulative over time: if some parts of a person's self are not actualized regularly, the person will have a growing feeling of inauthenticity that they will seek to resolve. In our present generalisation, the self is represented as a probability distribution, allowing it to be multi-modal (a person can maintain multiple different identities), uncertain (a person can be unsure about who they really are), and learnable (agents can learn the identities and selves of other agents). We show how the Bayesian affect control theory of self can underpin artificial agents that are socially intelligent.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9440/9290,Affect Control Theory; Probabilistic Reasoning; Markov decision process; Identity; Self; Affective Computing

Spontaneous uncued retrieval eliminates these requirements through automatic retrievals that use the agent's problem solving context as a heuristic for relevance, thus supplementing deliberate cued retrieval. Using constraints derived from this insight, we sketch the space of spontaneous retrieval mechanisms and describe an implementation of spontaneous retrieval in Soar together with an agent that takes advantage of that mechanism. Empirical evidence is provided in the Missing Link word-puzzle domain, where agents using spontaneous retrieval out-perform agents without that capability, leading us to conclude that spontaneous retrieval can be a useful mechanism and is worth further exploration.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9549/9292,spontaneous retrieval; missing link

First, domain-general cognitive models of analogical processes are used to handle a wider range of examples. Second, ALIGN’s analogical generalization process constructs multiple probabilistic representations per concept via clustering, and hence can learn disjunctive concepts.

Prasanna","Applications in sustainability domains such as in energy, transportation, and natural resource and environment monitoring, increasingly use sensors for collecting data and sending it back to centrally located processing nodes. While data can usually be collected by the sensors at a very high speed, in many cases, it can not be sent back to central nodes at a frequency that is required for fast and real-time modeling and decision-making. This may be due to physical limitations of the transmission networks, or due to consumers limiting frequent transmission of data from sensors located at their premises for security and privacy concerns. We propose a novel solution to the problem of making short term predictions in absence of real-time data from sensors. A key implication of our work is that by using real-time data from only a small subset of influential sensors, we are able to make predictions for all sen- sors. We evaluated our approach with a large real-world electricity consumption data collected from smart meters in Los Angeles and the results show that between prediction horizons of 2 to 8 hours, despite lack of real time data, our influence model outperforms the baseline model that uses real-time data.

Our empirical evaluation uses a real dataset for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), to validate the applicability of our approach in a realistic application scenario. Empirical results show that our approach computes optimal solutions for systems of medium scale (up to 100 agents) providing significant cost reductions (up to -36.22%). Moreover, we can provide approximate solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents) and good quality guarantees (i.e., with an approximation ratio of 1.41 in the worst case) within minutes (i.e., 100 seconds).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9622/9303,Coalition Formation; Social Networks; Ridesharing
85,2015,Computational Sustainability and AI,Best-Response Planning of Thermostatically Controlled Loads under Power Constraints,"Frits de Nijs, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Mathijs M. de Weerdt","Renewable power sources such as wind and solar are inflexible in their energy production, which requires demand to rapidly follow supply in order to maintain energy balance. Promising controllable demands are air-conditioners and heat pumps which use electric energy to maintain a temperature at a setpoint. Such Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) have been shown to be able to follow a power curve using reactive control. In this paper we investigate the use of planning under uncertainty to pro-actively control an aggregation of TCLs to overcome temporary grid imbalance. We present a formal definition of the planning problem under consideration, which we model using the Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MMDP) framework. Since we are dealing with hundreds of agents, solving the resulting MMDPs directly is intractable. Instead, we propose to decompose the problem by decoupling the interactions through arbitrage. Decomposition of the problem means relaxing the joint power consumption constraint, which means that joining the plans together can cause overconsumption. Arbitrage acts as a conflict resolution mechanism during policy execution, using the future expected value of policies to determine which TCLs should receive the available energy. We experimentally compare several methods to plan with arbitrage, and conclude that a best response-like mechanism is a scalable approach that returns near-optimal solutions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/10031/9304,Planning under uncertainty; Multi-Agent Markov Decision Processes; Decomposition; Arbitrage; Smart Grids
86,2015,Computational Sustainability and AI,FutureMatch: Combining Human Value Judgments and Machine Learning to Match in Dynamic Environments,"John P. Dickerson, Tuomas Sandholm","The preferred treatment for kidney failure is a transplant; however, demand for donor kidneys far outstrips supply.  Kidney exchange, an innovation where willing but incompatible patient-donor pairs can exchange organs- — via barter cycles and altruist-initiated chains —provides a life-saving alternative.Typically, fielded exchanges act myopically, considering only the current pool of pairs when planning the cycles and chains.  Yet kidney exchange is inherently dynamic, with participants arriving and departing.  Also, many planned exchange transplants do not go to surgery due to various failures. So, it is important to consider the future when matching. Motivated by our experience running the computational side of a large nationwide kidney exchange, we present FutureMatch, a framework for learning to match in a general dynamic model.  FutureMatch takes as input a high-level objective (e.g., ""maximize graft survival of transplants over time'') decided on by experts, then automatically (i) learns based on data how to make this objective concrete and (ii) learns the ``means'' to accomplish this goal — a task, in our experience, that humans handle poorly.  It uses data from all live kidney transplants in the US since 1987 to learn the quality of each possible match; it then learns the potentials of elements of the current input graph offline (e.g., potentials of pairs based on features such as donor and patient blood types), translates these to weights, and performs a computationally feasible batch matching that incorporates dynamic, failure-aware considerations through the weights. We validate FutureMatch on real fielded exchange data.  It results in higher values of the objective.  Furthermore, even under economically inefficient objectives that enforce equity, it yields better solutions for the efficient objective (which does not incorporate equity) than traditional myopic matching that uses the efficiency objective.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9497/9305,Kidney exchange; dynamic matching

We propose a new supervised algorithm, which in the learning stage, automatically extracts signature consumption patterns of each device by modeling the device as a mixture of dynamical systems. In order to extract signature consumption patterns of a device corresponding to its different modes of operation, we define appropriate dissimilarities between energy snippets of the device and use them in a subset selection scheme, which we generalize to deal with time-series data. We then form a dictionary that consists of extracted power signatures across all devices. We cast the disaggregation problem as an optimization over a representation in the learned dictionary and incorporate several novel priors such as device-sparsity, knowledge about devices that do or do not work together as well as temporal consistency of the disaggregated solution. Real experiments on a publicly available energy dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves promising results for energy disaggregation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9791/9306,

Unfortunately, resource preferences are often unknown to policy-makers and have to be inferred from data. In this paper we consider the problem of inferring agents' preferences from observed movement trajectories, and formulate it as an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem . With the goal of informing policy-making, we take a probabilistic approach and consider generative models that can be used to simulate behavior under new circumstances such as changes in resource availability, access policies, or climate. We study the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models from econometrics and prove that they generalize the Max-Entropy IRL model, a widely used probabilistic approach from the machine learning literature. Furthermore, we develop SPL-GD, a new learning algorithm for DDC models that is considerably faster than the state of the art and scales to very large datasets. We consider an application in the context of pastoralism in the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where migratory pastoralists face regular risks due to resource availability, droughts, and resource degradation from climate change and development.

A nonparametric model is developed using Gaussian Processes, which eschews the need for an explicit formulation of internal -- and usually very complex -- dependencies between meteorological variables. Instead, it uses historical data to extrapolate pollutant values both spatially (in areas with no sensor information) and temporally (the near future). Each prediction also contains a respective variance, indicating its uncertainty level and thus allowing a probabilistic treatment of results. A novel training methodology (Structural Cross-Validation) is presented, which preserves the spatio-temporal structure of available data during the hyperparameter optimization process. Tests were conducted using a real-time feed from a sensor network in an area of roughly 50x80 km, alongside comparisons with other techniques for air pollution prediction.

Optimal solutions consist in  a sequence of grid repairs and corresponding steady states. However,  such approaches lack formal guarantees on the transient stability of  restoration actions, a key property to avoid additional grid damage  and cascading failures.  In this paper, we show how to integrate  transient stability in the optimization procedure by capturing the  rotor dynamics of power generators. Our approach reasons about the  differential equations describing the dynamics and their underlying  transient states.  The key contribution lies in modeling and solving  optimization problems that return stable generators dispatch  minimizing the difference with respect to steady states  solutions.

We developed an algorithm that determines for a fleet of electric vehicles, which EV at what price and location to commit to the operating reserve market to either absorb excess capacity or provide electricity during shortages (vehicle-2-grid). The algorithm takes the value of immobility into account by using carsharing fees as a reference point. A virtual power plant autonomously replaces cars that are committed to the operating reserves and are then rented out, with other idle cars to pool the risks of uncertainty. We validate our model with data from a free float carsharing fleet of 500 electric vehicles. An analysis of expected future developments (2015, 2018, and 2022) in operating reserve demand and battery costs yields that the gross profits for a carsharing operator increase between 7-12% with a negligible decrease in car availability (<0.01%).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9867/9311,electric vehicles; virtual power plants; renwable energy; sustainability; agents

One powerful cue for breaking down the entire household's energy consumption is user's daily energy usage behavior, which has so far received little attention: existing works on energy disaggregation mostly ignored the relationship between the energy usages of various appliances across different time slots. To model such relationship, we combine topic models with Hawkes processes, and propose a novel probabilistic model based on marked Hawkes process that enables the modeling of marked event data. The proposed model seeks to capture the influence from the occurrence and the marks of one usage event to the occurrence and the marks of subsequent usage events in the future. We also develop an inference algorithm based on variational inference for model parameter estimation. Experimental results on both synthetic data and three real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in decomposing the entire consumed energy to each appliance. Analyzing the influence captured by the proposed model provides further insights into numerous interesting energy usage behavior patterns.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9623/9312,Energy disaggregation;Energy Usage Behavior;Marked Hawkes Process

The core component of our approach is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which optimally solves the joint occupancy scheduling and occupancy-based HVAC control problem.

In this paper, we propose a policy iteration method (along with specialized variants), which is able to calculate near-optimal trajectories for effective and efficient day-ahead solar tracking, based on weather forecasts coming from on-line providers.

Thus, this paper is motivated by the need to reduce the response time– time taken to arrive at the incident location after receivingthe emergency call — of Emergency Response Vehicles, ERVs(ex: ambulances, fire rescue vehicles) for as many requests as possible. We expect to achieve this primarily by positioning the ”right” number of ERVs at the ”right” places and at the ”right” times. Given the exponentially large action space(with respect to number of ERVs and their placement) and the stochasticity in location and timing of emergency incidents,this problem is computationally challenging. To that end, ourcontributions building on existing data-driven approaches are three fold:1. Based on real world evaluation metrics, we provide a riskbased optimization criterion to learn from past incident data. Instead of minimizing expected response time, we minimize the largest value of response time such that the risk of finding requests that have a higher value is bounded(ex: Only 10% of requests should have a response time greater than 8 minutes).2. We develop a mixed integer linear optimization formulation to learn and compute an allocation from a set of inputrequests while considering the risk criterion.3. To allow for ”live” reallocation of ambulances, we provide a decomposition method based on Lagrangian Relaxation to significantly reduce the run-time of the optimization formulation.Finally, we provide an exhaustive evaluation on real-world datasets from two asian cities that demonstrates the improvement provided by our approach over current practice and the best known approach from literature.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9427/9316,Emergency Medical Systems; Optimization; Lagrangian Dual Decomposition

The supply-demand imbalance manifests itself in many forms, from rolling brownouts in California to power cuts in India. It is often suggested that exposing consumers to real-time pricing, will incentivize them to change their usage and mitigate the problem - akin to increasing tolls at peak commute times. We show that risk-averse consumers of electricity react to price fluctuations by scaling back on their total demand, not just their peak demand, leading to the unintended consequence of an overall decrease in production/consumption and reduced economic efficiency. We propose a new scheme that allows homes to move their demands from peak hours in exchange for greater electricity consumption in non-peak hours - akin to how airlines incentivize a passenger to move from an over-booked flight in exchange for, say, two tickets in the future. We present a formal framework for the incentive model that is applicable to different forms of the electricity market. We show that our scheme not only enables increased consumption and consumer social welfare but also allows the distribution company to increase profits.

Users can pick up or drop off the bicycles  at a station of their choice without prior notice or time planning. This increased flexibility comes with the challenge of unpredictable and fluctuating demand as well as irregular flow patterns of the bikes. As a result, these systems can incur imbalance problems such as the unavailability of bikes or parking docks at stations. In this light, operators deploy fleets of vehicles which re-distribute the bikes in order to guarantee a desirable service level. Can we engage the users themselves to solve the imbalance  problem in bike sharing systems?  In this paper, we address this question and present a crowdsourcing mechanism that incentivizes the users in the bike repositioning process by providing them  with alternate choices to pick or return bikes in exchange for monetary incentives.  We design the complete architecture of the incentives system which employs optimal pricing policies using the approach of regret minimization in online learning. We investigate the incentive compatibility of our mechanism and extensively evaluate it through simulations based on data collected via a survey study. Finally, we deployed the proposed system through a smartphone app among users of a large scale bike sharing system operated by a public transport company, and we provide results from this experimental deployment.

This result is commonly seen as “too good to be true” (in practice), casting doubt on its modeling assumptions. In this paper, we use an automated mechanism design approach to assess how sensitive the Cremer-McLean result is to relaxing its main technical assumption. That assumption implies that each valuation that a bidder can have results in a unique conditional distribution over the external signal(s). We relax this, allowing multiple valuations to be consistent with the same distribution over the external signal(s). Using similar insights to Cremer-McLean, we provide a highly efficient algorithm for computing the optimal revenue in this more general case. Using this algorithm, we observe that indeed, as the number of valuations consistent with a distribution grows, the optimal revenue quickly drops to that of a reserve-price mechanism. Thus, automated mechanism design allows us to gain insight into the precise sense in which Cremer-McLean is “too good to be true.”",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9296/9367,Mechanism Design; Automated Mechanism Design; Simple Mechanisms; Incomplete Information; Optimal Mechanisms

The merchant observes only the purchased goods, and seeks to adapt prices to optimize his profits. We give an efficient algorithm for the merchant's problem that consists of a learning phase in which the consumer's utility function is (perhaps partially) inferred, followed by a price optimization step. We also give an alternative online learning algorithm for the setting where prices are set exogenously, but the merchant would still like to predict the bundle that will be bought by the consumer, for purposes of inventory or supply chain management. In contrast with most prior work on the revealed preferences problem, we demonstrate that by making stronger assumptions on the form of utility functions, efficient algorithms for both learning and profit maximization are possible, even in adaptive, online settings.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9984/9368,

While these underlying costs determine what the optimal alternative is, they may be unknown to the social choice mechanism; instead the mechanism must decide on a good alternative based only on the ordinal preferences of the agents which are induced by the underlying costs. Due to its limited information, such a social choice mechanism cannot simply select the alternative that minimizes the total social cost (or minimizes some other objective function). Thus, we seek to bound the distortion: the worst-case ratio between the social cost of the alternative selected and the optimal alternative. Distortion measures how good a mechanism is at approximating the alternative with minimum social cost, while using only ordinal preference information. The underlying costs can be arbitrary, implicit, and unknown; our only assumption is that the agent costs form a metric space, which is a natural assumption in many settings. We quantify the distortion of many well-known social choice mechanisms. We show that for both total social cost and median agent cost, many positional scoring rules have large distortion, while on the other hand Copeland and similar mechanisms perform optimally or near-optimally, always obtaining a distortion of at most 5. We also give lower bounds on the distortion that could be obtained by any deterministic social choice mechanism, and extend our results on median agent cost to more general objective functions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9643/9369,"social choice, distortion, metric preferences"

We show that for every list of ballots it is possible to select a committee that provides JR. We then check if this axiom is fulfilled by well-known approval-based voting rules. We show that the answer is negative for most of the rules we consider, with notable exceptions of PAV (Proportional Approval Voting), an extreme version of RAV (Reweighted Approval Voting), and, for a restricted preference domain, MAV (Minimax Approval Voting). We then introduce a stronger version of the JR axiom, which we call extended justified representation (EJR), and show that PAV satisfies EJR, while other rules do not. We also consider several other questions related to JR and EJR, including the relationship between JR/EJR and unanimity, and the complexity of the associated algorithmic problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9887/9370,

Procaccia, Arunesh Sinha","Modern organizations (e.g., hospitals, social networks, government agencies) rely heavily on audit to detect and punish insiders who inappropriately access and disclose confidential information. Recent work on audit games models the strategic interaction between an auditor with a single audit resource and auditees as a Stackelberg game, augmenting associated well-studied security games with a configurable punishment parameter. We significantly generalize this audit game model to account for multiple audit resources where each resource is restricted to audit a subset of all potential violations, thus enabling application to practical auditing scenarios. We provide an FPTAS that computes an approximately optimal solution to the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The main technical novelty is in the design and correctness proof of an optimization transformation that enables the construction of this FPTAS. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that this transformation significantly speeds up computation of solutions for a class of audit games and security games.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9783/11346,Auditing; Game Theory
110,2015,Game Theory and Economic Paradigms,Learning Valuation Distributions from Partial Observation,"Avrim Blum, Yishay Mansour, Jame Morgenstern","Auction theory traditionally assumes that bidders’ val- uation distributions are known to the auctioneer, such as in the celebrated, revenue-optimal Myerson auc- tion (Myerson 1981). However, this theory does not de- scribe how the auctioneer comes to possess this infor- mation. Recently work (Cole and Roughgarden 2014) showed that an approximation based on a finite sample of independent draws from each bidder’s distribution is sufficient to produce a near-optimal auction. In this work, we consider the problem of learning bidders’ val- uation distributions from much weaker forms of obser- vations. Specifically, we consider a setting where there is a repeated, sealed-bid auction with n bidders, but all we observe for each round is who won, but not how much they bid or paid. We can also participate (i.e., submit a bid) ourselves, and observe when we win. From this information, our goal is to (approximately) recover the inherently recoverable part of the underlying bid distributions. We also consider extensions where different subsets of bidders participate in each round, and where bidders’ valuations have a common-value component added to their independent private values.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9550/9375,

Although this solution concept is a cornerstone of many security applications, the existing works typically do not consider situations where the players can observe and react to the actions of the opponent during the course of the game. We extend the existing algorithmic work to extensive-form games and introduce novel algorithm for computing Stackelberg equilibria that exploits the compact sequence-form representation of strategies. Our algorithm reduces the size of the linear programs from exponential in the baseline approach to linear in the size of the game tree. Experimental evaluation on randomly generated games and a security-inspired search game demonstrates significant improvement in the scalability compared to the baseline approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9610/9372,Stackelberg Equilibrium; extensive-form games; mixed-integer linear programming

The size of the strategy space provides a computational challenge when solving these games. This complexity is tackled either by using the compact representation of sequential strategies and linear programming, or by incremental strategy generation of iterative double-oracle methods. In this paper, we present novel hybrid of these two approaches: compact-strategy double-oracle (CS-DO) algorithm that combines the advantages of the compact representation with incremental strategy generation. We experimentally compare CS-DO with the standard approaches and analyze the impact of the size of the support on the performance of the algorithms. Results show that CS-DO dramatically improves the convergence rate in games with non-trivial support",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9824/9373,normal-form games with sequential strategies; incremental strategy generation; zero-sum games

Most work on this topic assumes that strategizing only takes place among candidates, whereas voters vote truthfully. In this paper, we extend the analysis to also include strategic behavior on the part of the voters. (We also study cases where only candidates or only voters are strategic.) We consider two settings in which strategic voting is well-defined and has a natural interpretation: majority-consistent voting with single-peaked preferences and voting by successive elimination. In the former setting, we analyze the type of strategic behavior required in order to guarantee desirable voting outcomes. In the latter setting, we determine the complexity of computing the set of potential outcomes if both candidates and voters act strategically.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9968/9374,

Auctions with many bids can only be solved using a recently proposed core constraint generation (CCG) algorithm, which may still take days on hard instances. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that significantly outperforms the current state of the art. Towards this end, we first provide an alternative definition of the set of core constraints, where each constraint is weakly stronger, and prove that together these constraints define the identical polytope to the previous definition. Using these new theoretical insights we develop two new algorithmic techniques which generate additional constraints in each iteration of the CCG algorithm by 1) exploiting separability in allocative conflicts between participants in the auction, and 2) by leveraging non-optimal solutions. We show experimentally that our new algorithm leads to significant speed-ups on a variety of large combinatorial auction problems.

The continuous double auction (CDA) is a much more widely used microstructure for general financial markets in practice. In this paper, we study the properties of CDA prediction markets with zero-intelligence traders in which an LMSR-style market maker participates actively. We extend an existing idea of Robin Hanson for integrating LMSR with limit order books in order to provide a new, self-contained market making algorithm that does not need “special” access to the order book and can participate as another trader. We find that, as expected, the presence of the market maker leads to generally lower bid-ask spreads and higher trader surplus (or price improvement), but, surprisingly, does not necessarily improve price discovery and market efficiency; this latter effect is more pronounced when there is higher variability in trader beliefs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9735/9377,Prediction Market; Continuous Double Auction; Market Maker; Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule
116,2015,Game Theory and Economic Paradigms,Computing Nash Equilibrium in Interdependent Defense Games,"Hau Chan, Luis Ortiz","Roughly speaking, Interdependent Defense (IDD) games, previously proposed, model the situation where an attacker wants to cause as much damage as possible to a network by attacking one of the sites in the network. Each site must make an investment decision regarding security to protect itself against a direct or indirect attack, the latter due to potential transfer-risk from an unprotected neighboring site. The work introducing IDD games discusses potential applications to model the essence of real-world scenarios such as the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. In this paper, our focus is the study of the problem of computing a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in IDD games. We show that an efficient algorithm to determine whether some attacker’s strategy can be a part of a NE in an instance of IDD games is unlikely to exist. Yet, we provide a dynamic programming algorithm to compute an approximate NE when the graph/network structure of the game is a directed tree with a single source, and show that it is an FPTAS. We also introduce an improved heuristic to compute an approximate NE on arbitrary graph structures. Our experiments show that our heuristic is more efficient, and provides better approximations, than best-response-gradient dynamics for the case of Internet games, a class of games introduced and studied in the original work on IDD games.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9581/9378,

Each agent has different private information to incorporate into its search. This problem is inspired by settings such as scientific research, Bitcoin hash inversion, or hunting for some buried treasure. A social planner such as a funding agency, mining pool, or pirate captain might like to convince the agents to collaborate, share their information, and greatly reduce the cost of searching. However, this cooperation is in tension with the individuals' competitive desire to each be the first to win the search. The planner's proposal should incentivize truthful information sharing, reduce the total cost of searching, and satisfy fairness properties that preserve the spirit of the competition.  We design contract-based mechanisms for information sharing without money. The planner solicits the agents' information and assigns search locations to the agents, who may then search only within their assignments. Truthful reporting of information to the mechanism maximizes an agent's chance to win the search. Epsilon-voluntary participation is satisfied for large search spaces. In order to formalize the planner's goals of fairness and reduced search cost, we propose a simplified, simulated game as a benchmark and quantify fairness and search cost relative to this benchmark scenario. The game is also used to implement our mechanisms.

We show that suitable predictive features can be extracted from the data, and demonstrate the high performance of our new framework on the ballots from many real world elections, including comparisons with existing techniques for voting with partial orderings.

This problem models settings where we have partial knowledge regarding voters' preferences and we would like to understand whether the given preference profile may be single-crossing.  We show that this problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm when the order of votes is fixed and the input profile consists of top orders, but becomes NP-complete if we are allowed to permute the votes and the input profile consists of weak orders or independent-pairs orders.

Levels of the hierarchy correspond to the degree of complementarity in a given function. The highest level of the hierarchy, MPH-m (where m is the total number of items) captures all monotone functions. The lowest level, MPH-1, captures all monotone submodular functions, and more generally, the class of functions known as XOS. Every monotone function that has a positive hypergraph representation of rank k (in the sense defined by Abraham, Babaioff, Dughmi and Roughgarden [EC 2012]) is in MPH-k. Every monotone function that has supermodular degree k (in the sense defined by Feige and Izsak [ITCS 2013]) is in MPH-(k+1). In both cases, the converse direction does not hold, even in an approximate sense.  We present additional results that demonstrate the expressiveness power of MPH-k.One can obtain good approximation ratios for some natural optimization problems, provided that functions are required to lie in low levels of the MPH hierarchy. We present two such applications. One shows that the maximum welfare problem can be approximated within a ratio of k+1 if all players hold valuation functions in MPH-k.

In these games, a graph with designated source s and sink t is given, and each edge is associated with some cost. Each agent chooses strategically an s-t path, knowing that the cost of each edge is shared equally between all agents using it. Two variants of cost-sharing games have been previously studied: (i) games where coalitions can form, and (ii) games where edges are associated with capacities; both variants are inspired by real-life scenarios. In this work we combine these variants and analyze strong equilibria (profiles where no coalition can deviate) in capacitated games. This combination gives rise to new phenomena that do not occur in the previous variants. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we provide a topological characterization of networks that always admit a strong equilibrium. Second, we establish tight bounds on the efficiency loss that may be incurred due to strategic behavior, as quantified by the strong price of anarchy (and stability) measures. Interestingly, our results are qualitatively different than those obtained in the analysis of each variant alone, and the combination of coalitions and capacities entails the introduction of more refined topology classes than previously studied.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9675/9383,network congestion games; cost-sharing games; strong price of anarchy; strong equilibrium; coalitions; capacities; network topology

Consciousness is a central research theme in Neuroscience and AI, which remains, to date, an obscure phenomenon of human brains. Our starting point is a recent experiment, called Post Decision Wagering (PDW) (Persaud, McLeod, and Cowey 2007), that attempts to align experimenters' and subjects' objectives by leveraging financial incentives. We note a similarity with mechanism design, a research area which aims at the design of protocols that reconcile often divergent objectives through incentive-compatibility. We look at the issue of measuring awareness from this perspective. We abstract the setting underlying the PDW experiment and identify three factors that could make it ineffective: rationality, risk attitude and bias of subjects. Using mechanism design tools, we study the barrier between possibility and impossibility of incentive compatibility with respect to the aforementioned characteristics of subjects.

We mainly focus on the case where peaks are equidistant from the agents’ locations and discuss how our results extend to more general settings. We show that most of the results for single-peaked preferences do not directly apply to this setting; this makes the problem essentially more challenging. As our main contribution, we present a simple truthful-in-expectation mechanism that achieves an approximation ratio of 1+b/c for both the social and the maximum cost, where b is the distance of the agent from the peak and c is the minimum cost of an agent. For the latter case, we provide a 3/2 lower bound on the approximation ratio of any truthful-in-expectation mechanism.

Kash","We study the problem of eliciting and aggregating probabilistic information from multiple agents.  In order to successfully aggregate the predictions of agents, the principal needs to elicit some notion of confidence from agents, capturing how much experience or knowledge led to their predictions.  To formalize this, we consider a principal who wishes to learn the distribution of a random variable.  A group of Bayesian agents has each privately observed some independent samples of the random variable.  The principal wishes to elicit enough information from each agent, so that her posterior is the same as if she had directly received all of the samples herself. Leveraging techniques from Bayesian statistics, we represent confidence as the number of samples an agent has observed, which is quantified by a hyperparameter from a conjugate family of prior distributions.  This then allows us to show that if the principal has access to a few samples, she can achieve her aggregation goal by eliciting predictions from agents using proper scoring rules.  In particular, with access to one sample, she can successfully aggregate the agents' predictions if and only if every posterior predictive distribution corresponds to a unique value of the hyperparameter, a property which holds for many common distributions of interest.  When this uniqueness property does not hold, we construct a novel and intuitive mechanism where a principal with two samples can elicit and optimally aggregate the agents' predictions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9770/9386,"information elicitation, information aggregation, scoring rules; conjugate priors"

An assumption in most existing security game models is that one security resource assigned to a target only protects that target. However, in many important real-world security scenarios, when a resource is assigned to a target, it exhibits protection externalities: that is, it also protects other “neighbouring” targets. We investigate such Security Games with Protection Externalities (SPEs). First, we demonstrate that computing a strong Stackelberg equilibrium for an SPE is NP-hard, in contrast with traditional Stackelberg security games which can be solved in polynomial time. On the positive side, we propose a novel column generation based approach—CLASPE—to solve SPEs. CLASPE features the following novelties: 1) a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the slave problem; 2) an extended greedy approach with a constant-factor approximation ratio to speed up the slave problem; and 3) a linear-scale linear programming that efficiently calculates the upper bounds of target-defined subproblems for pruning.

Furthermore, the mechanism is individually rational in the sense that, in the long run, it guarantees each transplant center more matches than the center could have achieved alone.  The mechanism does not require assumptions about the underlying distribution of compatibility graphs — a nuance that has previously produced conflicting results in other aspects of theoretical kidney exchange.  Our results apply not only to matching via 2-cycles: the matchings can also include cycles of any length and altruist-initiated chains, which is important at least in kidney exchanges. The mechanism can also be adjusted to guarantee immediate individual rationality at the expense of economic efficiency, while preserving strategy proofness via the credits.  This circumvents a well-known impossibility result in static kidney exchange concerning the existence of an individually rational, strategy-proof, and maximal mechanism.

Controlled school choice programs need to provide choices for students/parents while maintaining distributional constraints on the balance on the composition of students, typically in terms of socioeconomic status. Previous works show that setting soft-bounds, which flexibly change the priorities of students based on their types, is more appropriate than setting hard-bounds, which strictly limit the number of accepted students for each type. We consider a case where soft-bounds are imposed and one student can belong to multiple types, e.g., ``financially-distressed'' and ``minority'' types. We first show that when we apply a model that is a straightforward extension of an existing model for disjoint types, there is a chance that no stable matching exists. Thus, we propose an alternative model and an alternative stability definition, where a school has reserved seats for each type. We show that a stable matching is guaranteed to exist in this model, and develop a mechanism called Deferred Acceptance for Overlapping Types (DA-OT). The DA-OT mechanism is strategy-proof and obtains the student-optimal matching within all stable matchings.

In order to maximize their success probability, attackers have to target the users that constitute the weakest links of the system. The optimal selection of these target users takes into account both the damage that can be caused by a user and the probability of a malicious e-mail being delivered to and opened by a user. Since attackers select their targets in a strategic way, the optimal mitigation of these attacks requires the defender to also personalize the e-mail filters by taking into account the users' properties.  In this paper, we assume that a learned classifier is given and propose strategic per-user filtering thresholds for mitigating spear-phishing attacks. We formulate the problem of filtering targeted and non-targeted malicious e-mails as a Stackelberg security game. We characterize the optimal filtering strategies and show how to compute them in practice.

We show this game may not always have a pure Nash equilibrium, in contrast to previous results for the special case where each vendor owns a single item. We do so by relating our game to an intermediate, discrete game in which the vendors only choose the available items, and their prices are set exogenously afterwards. We further make use of the intermediate game to provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy for the subset games that have pure Nash equilibria; we find that the optimal PoA reached in the previous special cases does not hold, but only a logarithmic one. Finally, we show that for a special case of submodular functions, efficient pure Nash equilibria always exist.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9587/9396,Game theory; Equilibrium; Price of anarchy; Price of stability

In this context, we investigate which solution concepts maximize the probability of ex-post stability (after the true values are revealed). We show how various conditions on the noise characterize the least core and the nucleolus as optimal.

Given this uncertainty, we model agents who either minimize their worst-case cost (WCC) or their worst-case regret (WCR), and study implications on equilibrium existence, convergence through adaptive play, and efficiency. Under the WCC behavior the game reduces to a modified congestion game,  and welfare improves when agents have moderate uncertainty.

Such procedures are defined by a voting rule and a (restricted) iterative process, where at each step one agent can modify his vote towards a better outcome for himself. It is already known that if the iteration dynamics (the manner in which voters are allowed to modify their votes) are unrestricted, then the voting process may not converge. For most common voting rules this may be observed even under the best response dynamics limitation. It is therefore important to investigate whether and which natural restrictions on the dynamics of iterative voting procedures can guarantee convergence. To this end, we provide two general conditions on the dynamics based on iterative myopic improvements, each of which is sufficient for convergence. We then identify several classes of voting rules (including Positional Scoring Rules, Maximin, Copeland and Bucklin), along with their corresponding iterative processes, for which at least one of these conditions hold.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9973/9399,

Our focus is on providing a better understanding regarding the set of equilibria attainable by iterative voting processes. We start with the basic model of plurality voting. We first establish some useful properties of equilibria, reachable by iterative voting, which enable us to show that deciding whether a given profile is an iteratively reachable equilibrium is NP-complete. We then proceed to combine iterative voting with the concept of truth bias, a model where voters prefer to be truthful when they cannot affect the outcome.  We fully characterise the set of attainable truth-biased equilibria, and show that it is possible to determine all such equilibria in polynomial time. Finally, we also examine the model of lazy voters, in which a voter may choose to abstain from the election. We establish convergence of the iterative process, albeit not necessarily to a Nash equilibrium. As in the case with truth bias, we also provide a polynomial time algorithm to find all the attainable equilibria.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9953/9402,

Applications include division of land as well as ad space in print and electronic media.

We thus introduce and study the problem of envy-free two-dimensional division wherein the utility of the agents depends on the geometric shape of the allocated pieces (as well as the location and size). In addition to envy-freeness, we require that the fraction allocated to each agent be at least a certain constant that depends only on the shape of the cake and the number of agents.

In an effort to address this problem, we propose an incentive-based, instructor-driven approach to orchestrate the interactions in online educational forums (OEFs). Our approach takes into account the heterogeneity in skills among the students as well as the limited budget available to the instructor. We first analytically model OEFs in a non-strategic setting using ideas from lumpable continuous time Markov chains and compute expected aggregate transient net-rewards for the instructor and the students. We next consider a strategic setting where we use the rewards computed above to set up a mixed-integer linear program  which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg game and recommends an optimal plan to the instructor for maximizing student participation.

The main solution concept there is the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE), which optimizes the defender's random allocation of limited security resources. However, solely deploying the SSE mixed strategy has limitations. In the extreme case, there are security games where the defender is able to defend all the assets ``almost perfectly"" at the SSE, but she still sustains significant loss. In this paper, we propose an approach for improving the defender's utility in such scenarios. Perhaps surprisingly, our approach is to strategically reveal to the attacker information about the sampled pure strategy. Specifically, we propose a two-stage security game model, where in the first stage the defender allocates resources and the attacker selects a target to attack, and in the second stage the defender strategically reveals local information about that target, potentially deterring the attacker's attack plan. We then study how the defender can play optimally in both stages.

Machine strategy is the generalized notion of automaton strategy, where the number of states in the automaton can be possibly infinite. We begin with the simple case where both players are confined to automata strategies, and then extend to general (possibly randomized) machine strategies. We first give a concise linear program to compute the optimal leader’s strategy and give two efficient implementations of the linear program: one via enumeration of a convex hull and the other via randomization. We then investigate the case where two machines have different levels of intelligence in the sense that one machine is able to record more history information than the other.

We evaluated a wide range of regression techniques, both in terms of how well they predict the performance of new hyperparameter settings and in terms of the quality of surrogate benchmarks obtained.

This paper introduces the concept of convergent evacuation plans to tackle this issue. It presents a MIP model to obtain optimal convergent evacuation plans which, unfortunately, does not scale to realistic instances. The paper then proposes a two-stage approach that separates the route design and the evacuation scheduling. Experimental results on a real case study show that the two-stage approach produces better primal bounds than the MIP model and is two orders of magnitude faster; It also produces dual bounds stronger than the linear relaxation of the MIP model.

This compression allows problems, unsolvable using standard LP techniques, to be solved effectively. Indeed, once a compressed LP is constructed, problems can solved in milliseconds. We provide a theoretical analysis of themethods, outline the distributed implementation of the requisite data processing, and show how a single compressed LP can be used to solve multiple variants of the original LP near-optimally in real-time (e.g., tosupport scenario analysis). We also show how the method can be leveraged in integer programming models.  Experimental results on marketing contact optimization and political legislature problems validate the performance of our technique.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9557/9356,optimization; linear programming; abstraction; marketing optimization; social choice; large-scale optimization; generalized assignment problem; generalized matching; parallel optimization; map reduce;
164,2015,Heuristic Search and Optimization,On Unconstrained Quasi-Submodular Function Optimization,"Jincheng Mei, Kang Zhao, Bao-Liang Lu","With the extensive application of submodularity, its generalizations are constantly being proposed. However, most of them are tailored for special problems. In this paper, we focus on quasi-submodularity, a universal generalization, which satisfies weaker properties than submodularity but still enjoys favorable performance in optimization. Similar to the diminishing return property of submodularity, we first define a corresponding property called the single sub-crossing, then we propose two algorithms for unconstrained quasi-submodular function minimization and maximization, respectively. The proposed algorithms return the reduced lattices in O(n) iterations, and guarantee the objective function values are strictly monotonically increased or decreased after each iteration. Moreover, any local and global optima are definitely contained in the reduced lattices. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms on lattice reduction.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9369/9357,

We then review several local search strategies that can be used to improve the BMF solutions obtained by previously proposed methods, before introducing a new local search dedicated to the BMF problem. We show in particular that the proposed solution is in general faster than the previously proposed ones. We then assess its behavior on several collections and methods and show that it significantly improves methods targeting the L2 norms on all the datasets considered; for the L1 norm, the improvement is also significant for real, structured datasets and for the BMF problem without the binary reconstruction constraint.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9515/9359,Matrix factorization; Local search; heuristics

However, theoretical analysis of this method is largely unavailable. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis that provides a bound on the endpoint solution of the continuation method.

Among these problems, important ones including the knapsack problems and the computation of edit distances between string pairs can be solved with a kind of DP that corresponds to solving the shortest path problem on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  These problems can be solved efficiently with DP, however, in practical situations, we want to solve the customized problems made by adding logical constraints to the original problems. Developing an algorithm specifically for each combination of a problem and a constraint set is unrealistic.  The proposed method, BDD-Constrained Search (BCS), exploits a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) that represents the logical constraints in combination with the DAG that represents the problem. The BCS runs DP on the DAG while using the BDD to check the equivalence and the validity of intermediate solutions to efficiently solve the problem.  The important feature of BCS is that it can be applied to problems with various types of logical constraints in a unified way once we represent the constraints as a BDD.  We give a theoretical analysis on the time complexity of BCS and also conduct experiments to compare its performance to that of a state-of-the-art integer linear programming solver.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9919/9362,

When natural disasters (e.g. Hurricane Sandy) occur, the ability of these networks to provide service is often degraded because of physical damage to network components. One of the most critical of these networks is the electrical distribution grid, with medium voltage circuits often suffering the  most severe damage. However, well-placed upgrades to these distribution grids can greatly improve post-event network performance.  We formulate an optimal electrical distribution grid design problem as a two-stage, stochastic mixed-integer program with damage scenarios from natural disasters modeled as a set of stochastic events. We develop and investigate the tractability of an exact and several heuristic algorithms based on decompositions that are hybrids of techniques developed by the AI and operations research communities.

We consider the following scenario: a requester has a set of tasks that must be completed before a deadline; agents (aka crowd workers) arrive over time and it is required to make sequential decisions regarding task allocation and pricing. Agents may have different costs for providing service and these costs are private information of the agents. We assume that agents are not strategic about their arrival times but could be strategic about their costs of service. In addition, agents could be unreliable in the sense of not being able to complete the assigned tasks within the allocated time; these tasks must then be reallocated to other agents to ensure ontime completion of the set of tasks by the deadline. For this setting, we propose two mechanisms: a DPM (DynamicPrice Mechanism) and an ABM (Auction Based Mechanism). Both mechanisms are dominant strategy incentive compatible, budget feasible, and also satisfy ex-post individual rationality for agents who complete the allocated tasks. These mechanisms can be implemented in current day crowdsourcing platforms with minimal changes to the current interaction model.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9777/9335,"Crowdsourcing, Mechanism Design, Auctions, Reliability, Online"

Recent work has looked towards soliciting transcriptions for large speech corpora from native speakers of the language using crowdsourcing techniques. However, native speakers of the target language may not be readily available for crowdsourcing. We examine the following question: can humans unfamiliar with the target language help transcribe? We follow an information-theoretic approach to this problem: (1) We learn the characteristics of a noisy channel that models the transcribers' systematic perception biases. (2) We use an error-correcting code, specifically a repetition code, to encode the inputs to this channel, in conjunction with a maximum-likelihood decoding rule. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we transcribe isolated Hindi words with the help of Mechanical Turk workers unfamiliar with Hindi. We successfully recover Hindi words with an accuracy of over 85% (and 94% in a 4-best list) using a 15-fold repetition code. We also estimate the conditional entropy of the input to this channel (Hindi words) given the channel output (transcripts from crowdsourced workers) to be less than 2 bits; this serves as a theoretical estimate of the average number of bits of auxiliary information required for errorless recovery.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9888/9336,Crowdsourcing; Repeated labeling; Speech transcription; Noisy-channel models

In this work, we study an alternative approach — Incentive Networks — in which a participant's reward  depends not only on his own contribution; but also in part on the contributions made by his social contacts or friends. We show that the key parameter effecting the efficiency of such an Incentive Network-based economic system depends on the participant's degree of directed altruism. Directed altruism is the extent to which someone is willing to work if his work results in a payment to his friend, rather than to himself. Specifically, we characterize the condition under which an Incentive Network-based economy is more efficient than the basic ""pay-for-your-contribution"" economy. We quantify by how much incentive networks can reduce the total reward that needs to be paid to the participants in order to achieve a certain overall contribution. Finally, we study the impact of the network topology and various exogenous parameters on the efficiency of incentive networks.

Such studies suggest that humans are diverse and dynamic when solving problems socially.

In this paper we analyse a recent social problem-solving model and attempt to address its shortcomings. Specifically, we investigate the effects of separating exploitation from exploration in agent behaviors and  explore the concept of diversity in such models. We found out that diverse populations outperform homogeneous ones in both efficient and inefficient networks. Finally, we show that agent diversity is more relevant than the strategic behavioral dynamics.

In this paper, we propose CrowdWON, a new graphical framework to describe and monitor crowd processes, the proposed language is able to represent the workflow of most well-known existing applications, extend previous modelling frameworks, and assist in the future generation of crowdsourcing platforms. Beyond previous proposals, CrowdWON allows for the formal definition of adaptative workflows, that depend on the skills of the crowd workers and/or process deadlines.

178,2015,Human-Computation and Crowd Sourcing,On the Impossibility of Convex Inference in Human Computation,"Nihar B. Shah, Dengyong Zhou","Human computation or crowdsourcing involves joint inference of the  ground-truth-answers and the worker-abilities by optimizing an objective function, for instance, by maximizing the data likelihood based on an assumed underlying model. A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature to address this inference problem. As far as we know, none of the objective functions in existing methods is convex. In machine learning and applied statistics, a convex function such as the objective function of support vector machines (SVMs) is generally preferred, since it can leverage the high-performance algorithms and rigorous guarantees established in the extensive literature on convex optimization. One may thus wonder if there exists a meaningful convex objective function for the inference problem in human computation. In this paper, we investigate this convexity issue for human computation. We take an axiomatic approach by formulating a set of axioms that impose two mild and natural assumptions on the objective function for the inference. Under these axioms, we show that it is unfortunately impossible to ensure convexity of the inference problem. On the other hand, we show that interestingly, in the absence of a requirement to model ""spammers"", one can construct reasonable objective functions for crowdsourcing that guarantee convex inference.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/10010/9340,crowdsourcing;inference;convex;axiomatic

It then determines the number of inter-dependent micro-tasks and the price to pay for each task within each workflow, given the corresponding budget constraints.

In crowdsourcing systems that can be modeled as multi-agent trust networks consist of resource constrained trustee agents (i.e., workers), workers may need to further sub-delegate tasks to others if they determine that they cannot complete all pending tasks before the stipulated deadlines. Existing reputation-based decision-making models cannot help workers decide when and to whom to sub-delegate tasks. In this paper, we proposed a reputation aware task sub-delegation (RTS) approach to bridge this gap. By jointly considering a worker's reputation, workload, the price of its effort and its trust relationships with others, RTS can be implemented as an intelligent agent to help workers make sub-delegation decisions in a distributed manner. The resulting task allocation maximizes social welfare through efficient utilization of the collective capacity of a crowd, and provides provable performance guarantees.

We provide results demonstrating the effectiveness of a suboptimal advising approach in extensive experiments in two canonical mixed agent-human advice-giving domains.

In order to help people in such situations, this paper provides an innovative methodology for developing an agent that can support people in argumentative discussions by proposing possible arguments to them.  By analyzing more than 130 human discussions and 140 questionnaires, answered by people, we show that the well-established Argumentation Theory is not a good predictor of people's choice of arguments. Then, we present a model that has 76% accuracy when predicting people’s top three argument choices given a partial deliberation. We present the Predictive and Relevance based Heuristic agent (PRH), which uses this model with a heuristic that estimates the relevance of possible arguments to the last argument given in order to propose possible arguments. Through extensive human studies with over 200 human subjects, we show that people’s satisfaction from the PRH agent is significantly higher than from other agents that propose arguments based on Argumentation Theory, predict arguments without the heuristics or only the heuristics.

Research has demonstrated that humans are able to recognize emotions in various domains, including speech and music, and that there are potential shared features that shape the emotion in both domains. In this paper, we investigate acoustic and visual features that are relevant to emotion perception in the domains of singing and speaking. We train regression models using two paradigms: (1) within-domain, in which models are trained and tested on the same domain and (2) cross-domain, in which models are trained on one domain and tested on the other domain. This strategy allows us to analyze the similarities and differences underlying the relationship between audio-visual feature expression and emotion perception and how this relationship is affected by domain of expression. We use kernel density estimation to model emotion as a probability distribution over the perception associated with multiple evaluators on the valence-activation space. This allows us to model the variation inherent in the reported perception. Results suggest that activation can be modeled more accurately across domains, compared to valence. Furthermore, visual features capture cross-domain emotion more accurately than acoustic features.

The objects are unknown and have arbitrary shapes. Therefore, we cannot rely on prior models. Instead, the robot learns online, from scratch, to manipulate the objects by trial and error. Grasping objects in clutter is significantly harder than grasping isolated objects, because the robot needs to push and move objects around  in order to create sufficient space for the fingers. These pre-grasping actions do not have an immediate utility, and may result in unnecessary delays. The utility of a pre-grasping action can be measured only by looking at the complete chain of consecutive actions and effects. This is a sequential decision-making problem that can be cast in the reinforcement learning framework. We solve this problem by learning the stochastic transitions between the observed states, using nonparametric density estimation. The learned transition function is used only for re-calculating the values of the executed actions in the observed states, with different policies. Values of new state-actions are obtained by regressing the values of the executed actions. The state of the system at a given time is a depth (3D) image of the scene.

However, a major challenge of successful applications of these techniques is the real-time prediction of breathing-induced tumor motion to accommodate system delivery latencies. Predicting respiratory motion in real-time is challenging. The current respiratory motion prediction approaches are still not satisfactory in terms of accuracy and interpretability due to the complexity of breathing patterns and the high inter-individual variability across patients. In this paper, we propose a novel respiratory motion prediction framework which integrates four key components: a personalized monitoring window generator, an orthogonal polynomial approximation-based pattern library builder, a variant best neighbor pattern searcher, and a statistical prediction decision maker. The four functional components work together into a real-time prediction system and is capable of performing personalized tumor position prediction during radiotherapy.

Such constraints make the construction of ad-hoc Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) unfeasible and impose early integration in already existing ITS, which possesses a large amount of tasks to be sequenced. However, such systems were not designed to be combined with Machine Learning methods and require several adjustments. As a consequence more than a half of the components based on recommender technology are never evaluated with an online experiment.

However, these intentions are often not directly derivable from the semantics of an utterance (e.g., when linguistic modulations are employed to convey polite-ness, respect, and social standing). Robotic architectures withsimple command-based natural language capabilities are thus not equipped to handle more liberal, yet natural uses of linguistic communicative exchanges. In this paper, we propose novel mechanisms for inferring in-tentions from utterances and generating clarification requests that will allow robots to cope with a much wider range of task-based natural language interactions. We demonstrate the potential of these inference algorithms for natural human-robot interactions by running them as part of an integrated cognitive robotic architecture on a mobile robot in a dialogue-based instruction task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9300/9332,speech act theory; intention understanding; human-robot interaction; integrated robot architectures; Dempster-Shafer theory

In particular, in this paper we consider their needs to i) reason with commonsense knowledge, ii) model their nondeterministic action outcomes and partial observability, and iii) plan toward maximizing long-term rewards. On one hand, Answer Set Programming (ASP) is good at representing and reasoning with commonsense and default knowledge, but is ill-equipped to plan under probabilistic uncertainty. On the other hand, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes(POMDPs) are strong at planning under uncertainty toward maximizing long-term rewards, but are not designed to incorporate commonsense knowledge and inference. This paper introduces the CORPP algorithm which combines P-log,a probabilistic extension of ASP, with POMDPs to integrate commonsense reasoning with planning under uncertainty.Our approach is fully implemented and tested on a shopping request identification problem both in simulation and on a real robot. Compared with existing approaches using P-log or POMDPs individually, we observe significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9918/9333,

With the widespread adoption of social media and mobile devices, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence, a unique opportunity arises for tackling mental health problems. In this study, we investigate how users’ online social activities and physiological signals detected through ubiquitous sensors can be utilized in realistic scenarios for monitoring their mental health states. First, we extract a suite of multimodal time-series signals using modern computer vision and signal processing techniques, from recruited participants while they are immersed in online social media that elicit emotions and emotion transitions.

Extracting modules of minimal size is, however, computationally hard, and often algorithmically infeasible. Thus, practical techniques are based on approximations, where M provably captures the relevant entailments, but is not guaranteed to be minimal. Existing approximations, however, ensure that M preserves all second-order entailments of T w.r.t. S, which is stronger than is required in many applications, and may lead to large modules in practice. In this paper we propose a novel approach in which module extraction is reduced to a reasoning problem in datalog. Our approach not only generalises existing approximations in an elegant way, but it can also be tailored to preserve only specific kinds of entailments, which allows us to extract significantly smaller modules.

Many of these languages can be viewed as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. Language BC+ is defined as a high level notation of propositional formulas under the stable model semantics. Due to the generality of the underlying language, BC+ is expressive enough to encompass many modern ASP language constructs and the best features of several other action languages, such as B, C, C+ and BC. Computational methods available in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led us to implement the language by extending system Cplus2ASP.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9599/9414,

Different query languages and stream processing/reasoning engines were proposed. However, due to a lack of theoretical foundations, the expressivity and semantics of these diverse approaches were only informally discussed. Towards clear specifications and means for analytic study, a formal framework is needed to characterize their semantics in precise terms. We present LARS, a Logic-based framework for Analyzing Reasoning over Streams, i.e., a rule-based formalism with a novel window operator providing a flexible mechanism to represent views on streaming data. We establish complexity results for central reasoning tasks and show how the prominent Continuous Query Language (CQL) can be captured. Moreover, the relation between LARS and ETALIS, a system for complex event processing is discussed.

A crucial challenge of this task lies in the nonmonotonicity of standard logic programming semantics. Existing approaches have thus used the monotonic characterisation via SE-models to develop semantic revision operators, which however neglect any syntactic information, or reverted to a syntax-oriented belief base approach altogether. In this paper, we bridge the gap between semantic and syntactic techniques by adapting the idea of a partial meet construction from classical belief change. This type of construction allows us to define new model-based operators for revising as well as contracting logic programs that preserve the syntactic structure of the programs involved. We demonstrate the rationality of our operators by testing them against the classic AGM or alternative belief change postulates adapted to the logic programming setting. We further present an algorithm that reduces the partial meet revision or contraction of a logic program to performing revision or contraction only on the relevant subsets of that program.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9756/9416,

For example, all major semantics of logic programming, autoepistemic logic, default logic and more recently, abstract argumentation have been shown to be induced by the different types of fixpoints defined in approximation fixpoint theory (AFT). In this paper, we add a new type of fixpoint to AFT: a grounded fixpoint of lattice operator O : L → L is defined as a lattice element x ∈ L such that O(x) = x and for all v ∈ L such that O(v ∧ x) ≤ v, it holds that x ≤ v. On the algebraical level, we show that all grounded fixpoints are minimal fixpoints approximated by the well-founded fixpoint and that all stable fixpoints are grounded. On the logical level, grounded fixpoints provide a new mathematically simple and compact type of semantics for any logic with a (possibly non-monotone) semantic operator. We explain the intuition underlying this semantics in the context of logic programming by pointing out that grounded fixpoints of the immediate consequence operator are interpretations that have no non-trivial unfounded sets. We also analyse the complexity of the induced semantics. Summarised, grounded fixpoint semantics is a new, probably the simplest and most compact, element in the family of semantics that capture basic intuitions and principles of various non-monotonic logics. ",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9324/9418,Approximation Fixpoint Theory; Lattice operator; Stable semantics; Well-founded semantics; Groundedness

Notably, the approach is syntax-independent, so that if two programs are strongly equivalent, then the result of forgetting a given atom in each program is also strongly equivalent. Our central definition of forgetting is abstract: forgetting an atom from program P is characterised by the set of those SE consequences of P that do not mention the atom to be forgotten. We provide an equivalent, syntactic, characterization in which forgetting an atom p is given by those rules in the program that do not mention p, together with rules obtained by a single inference step from those rules that do mention p. Forgetting is shown to have appropriate properties; in particular, answer sets are preserved in forgetting an atom. As well, forgetting an atom via the syntactic characterization results in a modest (at worst quadratic) blowup in the program size.

To tackle this problem while achieving tractability, we generalize ABox abduction from the classical semantics to an inconsistency-tolerant semantics, namely the Intersection ABox Repair (IAR) semantics, and propose the notion of IAR-explanations in inconsistent DL ontologies. We show that computing all minimal IAR-explanations is tractable in data complexity for first-order rewritable ontologies.

On the other hand, based on the notion of elementary loops, the class of Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) programs was presented, which can be turned into equivalent normal logic programs by shifting head atoms into bodies. However, the problem of recognizing an HEF program is coNP-complete. Then we present a subclass of HEF programs which generalizes the class of Head-Cycle-Free programs and provide a polynomial time algorithm to identify them.

In particular, not much is known about the interplay between DLs and XPath. The latter is a powerful formalism for querying semistructured data: it is in the core of most practical query languages for XML trees, and it is also gaining popularity in theory and practice of graph databases. In this paper we make a step towards coupling knowledge bases and graph databases by studying how to answer powerful XPath-style queries over simple DLs like DL-Lite and EL. We start with adapting the definition of XPath to the DL context, and then proceed to study the complexity of evaluating XPath queries over knowledge bases. Results show that, while query answering is undecidable for the full XPath, by carefully tuning the shape of negation allowed in the queries we can arrive at XPath fragments that have a potential to be used in practice.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9459/9428,Description Logics; EL; DL-Lite; Ontology-based query answering; OBDA; graph databases; XPath

An epistemic state in their sense consists of a belief set and a set of conditional beliefs. Although the denotation of an epistemic state can be indirectly captured by a total preorder on the set of worlds, it is unclear how to directly capture the structure in terms of the beliefs and conditional beliefs it contains. In this paper, we first provide an axiomatic characterisation for epistemic states by using nine rules about beliefs and conditional beliefs, and then argue that the last two rules are too strong and should be eliminated for characterising the belief state of an agent. We call a structure which satisfies the first seven rules a general epistemic state (GEP). To provide a semantical characterisation of GEPs, we introduce a mathematical structure called belief algebra, which is in essence a certain binary relation defined on the power set of worlds.We then establish a 1-1 correspondence between GEPs and belief algebras, and show that total preorders on worlds are special cases of belief algebras.

Recently, a modal variant of the situation calculus was proposed, which allows an agent to revise its beliefs based on so-called belief conditionals as part of its knowledge base.

220,2015,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,Interactive Query-Based Debugging of ASP Programs,Kostyantyn Shchekotykhin,"Broad application of answer set programming (ASP) for declarative problem solving requires the development of tools supporting the coding process. Program debugging is one of the crucial activities within this process. Modern ASP debugging approaches allow efficient computation of possible explanations of a fault. However, even for a small program a debugger might return a large number of possible explanations and selection of the correct one must be done manually. In this paper we present an interactive query-based ASP debugging method which extends previous approaches and finds the preferred explanation by means of observations. The system automatically generates a sequence of queries to a programmer asking whether a set of ground atoms must be true in all (cautiously) or some (bravely) answer sets of the program. Since some queries can be more informative than the others, we discuss query selection strategies which - given user's preferences for an explanation - can find the most informative query reducing the overall number of queries required for the identification of a preferred explanation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9400/9438,Logic programming; Answer set programming; Debugging
221,2015,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,Exploring the KD45 Property of a Kripke Model After the Execution of an Action Sequence,"Tran Cao Son, Enrico Pontelli, Chitta Baral, Gregory Gelfond","The paper proposes a condition for preserving the KD45 property of a Kripke model when a sequence of update models is applied to it. The paper defines the notions of a primitive update model and a semi-reflexive KD45 (or sr-KD45) Kripke model.  It proves that updating a sr-KD45 Kripke model using a primitive update model results in a sr-KD45 Kripke model, i.e., a primitive update model preserves the properties of a sr-KD45 Kripke model. It shows that several update models for modeling well-known actions found in the literature are  primitive. This result provides guarantees that can be useful in presence of multiple applications of actions in multi-agent system (e.g., multi-agent planning).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9551/9440,Kripke model; update model; belief and knowledge
222,2015,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,Answering Conjunctive Queries over EL Knowledge Bases with Transitive and Reflexive Roles,"Giorgio Stefanoni, Boris Motik","Answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over EL knowledge bases (KBs) with complex role inclusions is PSPACE-hard and in PSPACE in certain cases; however, if complex role inclusions are restricted to role transitivity, a tight upper complexity bound has so far been unknown. Furthermore, the existing algorithms cannot handle reflexive roles, and they are not practicable. Finally, the problem is tractable for acyclic CQs and ELH, and NP-complete for unrestricted CQs and ELHO KBs. In this paper we complete the complexity landscape of CQ answering for several important cases. In particular, we present a practicable NP algorithm for answering CQs over ELHOs KBs—a logic containing all of OWL 2 EL, but with complex role inclusions restricted to role transitivity. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that the algorithm can be suitable for practical use. Moreover, we show that, even for a restricted class of so-called arborescent acyclic queries, CQ answering over EL KBs becomes NP-hard in the presence of either transitive or reflexive roles. Finally, we show that answering arborescent CQs over ELHO KBs is tractable, whereas answering acyclic CQs is NP-hard.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9310/9441,OWL 2 EL; Conjunctive Queries; Acyclic Conjunctive Queries; Transitive Roles; Reflexive Roles

This raises the question of how to use such a large set of diagnoses. For example, presenting hundreds of diagnoses to a human operator (charged with repairing the system) is meaningless. In various settings, including decision support for a human operator and automated troubleshooting processes, it is sufficient to be able to answer a basic diagnostic question: is a given component faulty? We propose a way to aggregate an arbitrarily large set of diagnoses to return an estimate of the likelihood of a given component to be faulty. The resulting mapping of components to their likelihood of being faulty is called the system's health state. We propose two metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a health state and show that an accurate health state can be found without finding all diagnoses. An empirical study explores the question of how many diagnoses are needed to obtain an accurate enough health state, and a simple online stopping criterion is proposed.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9952/9442,Diagnosis; Reasoning

In this paper, we present techniques to model and infer object labels in real scenes based on a variety of spatial relations — geometric features which capture how objects co-occur — and compare their efficacy in the context of augmenting perception based object classification in real-world table-top scenes. We utilise a long-term dataset of office table-tops for qualitatively comparing the performances of these techniques. On this dataset, we show that more intricate techniques, have a superior performance but do not generalise well on small training data.

226,2015,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,On the Role of Canonicity in Knowledge Compilation,"Guy Van den Broeck, Adnan Darwiche","Knowledge compilation is a powerful reasoning paradigm with many applications across AI and computer science more broadly. We consider the problem of bottom-up compilation of knowledge bases, which is usually predicated on the existence of a polytime function for combining compilations using Boolean operators (usually called an Apply function). While such a polytime Apply function is known to exist for certain languages (e.g., OBDDs) and not exist for others (e.g., DNNFs), its existence for certain languages remains unknown. Among the latter is the recently introduced language of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs): while a polytime Apply function exists for SDDs, it was unknown whether such a function exists for the important subset of compressed SDDs which are canonical. We resolve this open question in this paper and consider some of its theoretical and practical implications.

In particular, some properties that are essential for existing proposals do not hold any longer or have to be reformulated.

Thus, automated ontology learning and evolution have attracted intensive research interest. In data-centric applications where ontologies are designed from the data or automatically learnt from it, when new data instances are added that contradict the ontology, it is often desirable to incrementally revise the ontology according to the added data. In description logics, this problem can be intuitively formulated as the operation of TBox contraction, i.e., rational elimination of certain axioms from the logical consequences of a TBox, and it is w.r.t. an ABox. In this paper we introduce a model-theoretic approach to such a contraction problem by using an alternative semantic characterisation of DL-Lite TBoxes. We show that entailment checking (without necessarily first computing the contraction result) is in coNP, which does not shift the corresponding complexity in propositional logic, and the problem is tractable when the size of the new data is bounded.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9809/9447,"ontology change, belief revision, DL-Lite"

Therefore, in this paper we introduces Path-Ranking to capture the long-range interactions of knowledge graph and at the same time preserve the pairwise relations of knowledge graph; we call it 'structured embedding via pairwise relation and long-range interactions' (referred to as SePLi).

In the past few years, a number of rule languages with finite chase have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel approach for classifying the rule languages with finite chase. Using this approach, a family of decidable rule languages, which extend the existing languages with the finite chase property, are naturally defined. We then study the complexity of these languages. Although all of them are tractable for data complexity, we show that their combined complexity can be arbitrarily high. Furthermore, we prove that all the rule languages with finite chase that extend the weakly acyclic language are of the same expressiveness as the weakly acyclic one, while rule languages with higher combined complexity are in general more succinct than those with lower combined complexity.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9579/9450,existential rules; finite chase; complexity; expressiveness; succinctness

The main goal is to make the process of introducing new medical interventions to patients more efficient by reducing the cost and the time associated with evaluating their safety and efficacy. The principal question is how should adaptation be performed so as to minimize the chance of distorting the outcome of the trial. We propose a novel method for achieving this. Unlike previous work our approach focuses on trial adaptation by sample size adjustment. We adopt a recently proposed stratification framework based on collected auxiliary data and show that this information together with the primary measured variables can be used to make a probabilistically informed choice of the particular sub-group a sample should be removed from.

Heart rate and skin conductance, as well as other peripheral physiology measures, have previously shown utility in predicting binary diagnostic decisions. The binary decision problem is easier, but misses important information on the severity of the patient’s condition. This work utilizes a novel experimental set-up that exploits virtual reality videos and peripheral physiology for PTSD diagnosis. In pursuit of an automated physiology-based objective diagnostic method, we propose a learning formulation that integrates the description of the experimental data and expert knowledge on desirable properties of a physiological diagnostic score. From a list of desired criteria, we derive a new cost function that combines regression and classification while learning the salient features for predicting physiological score. The physiological score produced by Sparse Combined Regression-Classification (SCRC) is assessed with respect to three sets of criteria chosen to reflect design goals for an objective, physiological PTSD score: parsimony and context of selected features, diagnostic score validity, and learning generalizability. For these criteria, we demonstrate that Sparse Combined Regression-Classification performs better than more generic learning approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9695/9453,PTSD; physiology based diagnosis; cost function; classification; regression

We reduce multi-label learning problem into an additional link prediction task and solve both problems with marginalized denoising, which we co-regularize with Laplacian smoothing.

Both the group and graph structural properties co-exist in many applications. However, group sparsity and graph sparsity have not been considered simultaneously yet. In this paper, we propose a g2-regularization that takes group and graph sparsity into joint consideration, and present an effective approach for its optimization.

The various types of content information available on LBSNs could be related to different aspects of a user's check-in action, providing a unique opportunity for POI recommendation. In this work, we study the content information on LBSNs w.r.t. POI properties, user interests, and sentiment indications.

Issues include noisy backgrounds and faded text due to aging, border/marginal noise, bleed-through, skewing, warping, as well as irregular fonts and page layouts. As a result, OCR tools often produce a large number of spurious bounding boxes (BBs) in addition to those that correspond to words in the document.  This paper presents an iterative classification algorithm to automatically label BBs (i.e., as text or noise) based on their spatial distribution and geometry. The approach uses a rule-base classifier to generate initial text/noise labels for each BB, followed by an iterative classifier that refines the initial labels by incorporating local information to each BB, its spatial location, shape and size. When evaluated on a dataset containing over 72,000 manually-labeled BBs from 159 historical documents, the algorithm can classify BBs with 0.95 precision and 0.96 recall. Further evaluation on a collection of 6,775 documents with ground-truth transcriptions shows that the algorithm can also be used to predict document quality (0.7 correlation) and improve OCR transcriptions in 85% of the cases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9965/9458,optical character recognition;machine learning;digital humanities;document triage

Although automatic assessment in PD has been studied extensively, so far no approach has been devised that is useful for clinical practice. Analysis approaches common for the field lack the capability of exploiting data from realistic environments, which represents a major barrier towards practical assessment systems. The very unreliable and infrequent labelling of ambiguous, low resolution movement data collected in such environments represents a very challenging analysis setting, where advances would have significant societal impact in our ageing population. In this work we propose an assessment system that abides practical usability constraints and applies deep learning to differentiate disease state in data collected in naturalistic settings.

242,2015,Machine Learning Applications,Exploiting Determinism to Scale Relational Inference,"Mohamed Hamza Ibrahim, Christopher Pal, Gilles Pesant","One key challenge in statistical relational learning (SRL) is  scalable inference. Unfortunately, most real-world problems in SRL have expressive models that translate into large grounded networks, representing a bottleneck for any inference method and weakening its scalability. In this paper we introduce Preference Relaxation (PR), a two-stage strategy that uses the determinism present in the underlying model to improve the scalability of relational inference. The basic idea of PR is that if the underlying model involves mandatory (i.e. hard) constraints as well as preferences (i.e. soft constraints) then it is potentially wasteful to allocate memory for all constraints in advance when performing inference. To avoid this, PR starts by relaxing preferences and performing inference with hard constraints only. It then removes variables that violate hard constraints, thereby avoiding irrelevant computations involving preferences. In addition it uses the removed variables to enlarge the evidence database. This reduces the effective size of the grounded network. Our approach is general and can be applied to various inference methods in relational domains. Experiments on real-world applications show how PR substantially scales relational inference with a minor impact on accuracy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9800/9461,Statistical Relational Learning; Relational Inference; Markov Logic Networks

We show that the improvement of a user's interpretability through the use of a topic modeling-based compression technique is statistically significant, according to a number of metrics, when compared with other representations. Also, we find that this representation is scalable --- it maintains alignment with human classification accuracy as an increasing number of data points are shown.

245,2015,Machine Learning Applications,Nonstationary Gaussian Process Regression for Evaluating Repeated Clinical Laboratory Tests,Thomas A. Lasko,"Sampling repeated clinical laboratory tests with appropriate timing is challenging because the latent physiologic function being sampled is in general nonstationary. When ordering repeated tests, clinicians adopt various simple strategies that may or may not be well suited to the behavior of the function. Previous research on this topic has been primarily focused on cost-driven assessments of oversampling. But for monitoring physiologic state or for retrospective analysis, undersampling can be much more problematic than oversampling. In this paper we analyze hundreds of observation sequences of four different clinical laboratory tests to provide principled, data-driven estimates of undersampling and oversampling, and to assess whether the sampling adapts to changing volatility of the latent function. To do this, we developed a new method for fitting a Gaussian process to samples of a nonstationary latent function. Our method includes an explicit estimate of the latent function's volatility over time, which is deterministically related to its nonstationarity. We find on average that the degree of undersampling is up to an order of magnitude greater than oversampling, and that only a small minority are sampled with an adaptive strategy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9464/9464,Gaussian Processes; Nonstationarity; Approximate Inference; Medicine; Secondary Use; Clinical Laboratory Tests; Sampling Strategies; Utilization Management

Schema matching lifts data integration - traditionally focused on well-structured data - to highly heterogeneous sources. While schema matching has enjoyed significant success in matching data attributes, inconsistencies can exist at a deeper level, making full integration difficult or impossible. We propose a more fine-grained approach that focuses on correspondences between the values of attributes across data sources. Since the semantics of attribute values derive from their use and co-occurrence, we argue for the suitability of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants. We demonstrate the superior statistical and computational performance of multiple sparse CCA compared to a suite of baseline algorithms, on two datasets which we are releasing to stimulate further research.

248,2015,Machine Learning Applications,A Regularized Linear Dynamical System Framework for Multivariate Time Series Analysis,"Zitao Liu, Milos Hauskrecht","Linear Dynamical System (LDS) is an elegant mathematical framework for modeling and learning Multivariate Time Series (MTS). However, in general, it is difficult to set the dimension of an LDS's hidden state space. A small number of hidden states may not be able to model the complexities of a MTS, while a large number of hidden states can lead to overfitting. In this paper, we study learning methods that impose various regularization penalties on the transition matrix of the LDS model and propose a regularized LDS learning framework (rLDS) which aims to (1) automatically shut down LDSs' spurious and unnecessary dimensions, and consequently, address the problem of choosing the optimal number of hidden states; (2) prevent the overfitting problem given a small amount of MTS data; and (3) support accurate MTS forecasting. To learn the regularized LDS from data we incorporate a second order cone program and a generalized gradient descent method into the Maximum a Posteriori framework and use Expectation Maximization to obtain a low-rank transition matrix of the LDS model. We propose two priors for modeling the matrix which lead to two instances of our rLDS. We show that our rLDS is able to recover well the intrinsic dimensionality of the time series dynamics and it improves the predictive performance when compared to baselines on both synthetic and real-world MTS datasets.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9692/9467,Linear Dynamical System; Multivariate Time Series; Low Rank Approximation

We prove that GSVT can be obtained by performing the proximal operator of g on the singular values since Proxg(.) is monotone when g is lower bounded. If the nonconvex g satisfies some conditions (many popular nonconvex surrogate functions, e.g., lp-norm, 0 < p < 1, of l0-norm are special cases), a general solver to find Proxg(b) is proposed for any b ≥ 0. GSVT greatly generalizes the known Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) which is a basic subroutine in many convex low rank minimization methods.

In this paper, we develop the first linear-time algorithm for maximizing a general monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. We show that our randomized algorithm, STOCHASTIC-GREEDY, can achieve a (1 − 1/e − ε) approximation guarantee, in expectation, to the optimum solution in time linear in the size of the data and independent of the cardinality constraint. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on submodular functions arising in data summarization, including training large-scale kernel methods, exemplar-based clustering, and sensor placement. We observe that STOCHASTIC-GREEDY practically achieves the same utility value as lazy greedy but runs much faster. More surprisingly, we observe that in many practical scenarios STOCHASTIC-GREEDY does not evaluate the whole fraction of data points even once and still achieves indistinguishable results compared to lazy greedy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9956/9469,"submodular functions, approximation algorithms, greedy algorithms"

Regularization on state transitions provides smooth transitioning among states, such that the sequences are split into  broad, contiguous segments. Our methods are compared with a recent hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) and a baseline standard hidden Markov model, of which the former suffers from poor performance on moderate-dimensional data and sensitivity to parameter settings, while the latter suffers from rapid state transitioning, over-segmentation and poor performance on a segmentation task involving human activity accelerometer data from the UCI Repository. The regularized methods developed here are able to perfectly characterize change of behavior in the human activity data for roughly half of the real-data test cases, with accuracy of 94% and low variation of information. In contrast to the HDP-HMM, our methods provide simple, drop-in replacements for standard hidden Markov model update rules, allowing standard expectation maximization (EM) algorithms to be used for learning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9475/9470,state-persistent HMMs; hidden Markov models; segmenting time series; multivariate time series

Known as algorithm selection, this issue has been prevailing in many domains, as no single algorithm can perform best on all problem instances. Traditional algorithm selection and portfolio construction methods typically treat the problem as a classification or regression task. In this paper, we present a new approach that provides a more natural treatment of algorithm selection and portfolio construction as a ranking task. Accordingly, we develop a Ranking-Based Algorithm Selection (RAS) method, which employs a simple polynomial model to capture the ranking of different solvers for different problem instances. We devise an efficient iterative algorithm that can gracefully optimize the polynomial coefficients by minimizing a ranking loss function, which is derived from a sound probabilistic formulation of the ranking problem.

However, most existing work focuses on learning a single ranking function whilst in many real world applications, there can be many ranking functions to fulfill various retrieval tasks on the same data set. How to train many ranking functions is challenging due to the limited availability of training data which is further compounded when plentiful training data is available for a small subset of the ranking functions. This is particularly true in settings, such as personalized ranking/retrieval, where each person requires a unique ranking function according to their preference, but only the functions of the persons who provide sufficient ratings (of objects, such as movies and music) can be well trained. To address this, we propose to construct a graph where each node corresponds to a retrieval task, and then propagate ranking functions on the graph.

The usual representation of these data sets is an information table, assuming the independence of attributes. However, very often, they are actually interdependent on one another, either explicitly or implicitly. Limited research has been conducted in analyzing such attribute interactions, which causes the analysis results to be more local than global. This paper proposes the coupled heterogeneous attribute analysis to capture the interdependence among mixed data by addressing coupling context and coupling weights in unsupervised learning. Such global couplings integrate the interactions within discrete attributes, within numerical attributes and across them to form the coupled representation for mixed type objects based on dimension conversion and feature selection. This work makes one step forward towards explicitly modeling the interdependence of heterogeneous attributes among mixed data, verified by the applications in data structure analysis, data clustering evaluation, and density comparison. Substantial experiments on 12 UCI data sets show that our approach can effectively capture the global couplings of heterogeneous attributes and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, supported by statistical analysis.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9826/9476,Coupling Relationship; Interdependence; Heterogenous Attributes; Mixed Data

In order to improve the robustness of gait-based person re-identification on such multi-covariate conditions, a novel Swiss-system based cascade ranking model is proposed in this paper. Since the ranking model is able to learn a subspace where the potential true match is given the highest ranking, we formulate the gait-based person re-identification as a bipartite ranking problem and utilize it as an effective way for multi-feature ensemble learning. Then a Swiss multi-round competition system is developed for the cascade ranking model to optimize its effectiveness and efficiency.

User interests are modeled as latent factors and each user is assumed to have a distribution over them. By inferring the latent factors and users' distributions, we can discover what the users are interested in. We model image contents with a four-level hierarchical structure where the layers correspond to themes, semantic regions, visual words and pixels respectively. Users' latent interests are embedded in the theme layer. Given image contents, users' interests can be discovered by doing posterior inference.

Traditionally, these two processes are conducted separately and their correlation is generally ignored.In this paper, we propose a Double Layer Gaussian Mixture Model (DLGMM) to simultaneously perform image clustering and codebook learning. In DLGMM, two tasks are seamlessly coupled and can mutually promote each other. Cluster labels and codebook are jointly estimated to achieve the overall best performance. To incorporate the spatial coherence between neighboring visual patches, we propose a Spatially Coherent DLGMM which uses a Markov Random Field to encourage neighboring patches to share the same visual word label.We use variational inference to approximate the posterior of latent variables and learn model parameters.Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of two models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9739/9482,

Stability, a manifest of reproducibility of statistical results subject to reasonable perturbations to data and the model (Yu 2013), is an important focus in statistics, especially in the analysis of high dimensional data. In this paper, we explore a nonnegative generalized fused lasso model for stable feature selection in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to sparsity, our model incorporates two important pathological priors: the spatial cohesion of lesion voxels and the positive correlation between the features and the disease labels. To optimize the model, we propose an efficient algorithm by proving a novel link between total variation and fast network flow algorithms via conic duality.

Although the issue has been studied previously, most existing work focus on arterial roads only, where sensors are configured closely for collecting complete real-time data. For collector roads where sensors sparsly cover, however, speed predictions are often ignored. With GPS-equipped floating car signals being available nowadays, we aim at forecasting collector road speeds by utilizing these signals. The main challenge compared with arterial roads comes from the missing data. In a time slot of the real case, over 90% of collector roads cannot be covered by enough floating cars. Thus most traditional approaches for arterial roads, relying on complete historical data, cannot be employed directly. Aiming at solving this problem, we propose a multi-view road speed prediction framework. In the first view, temporal patterns are modeled by a layered hidden Markov model; and in the second view, spatial patterns are modeled by a collective matrix factorization model.

Simply considering labels as  independent or correlated is crude; it would be beneficial to define and exploit the causality between multiple labels.

Since the original features are a disorderly mixture of the properties originating from different labels, it is intuitive to factorize these raw features to clearly represent each individual label and its causality relationship.Following the large-margin principle, we propose an effective approach to discover the causal features of multiple labels,  thus revealing the causality  between labels from the perspective of feature. We show theoretically that the proposed approach is a tight approximation of the empirical multi-label classification error, and the  causality revealed  strengthens the consistency of the algorithm.

To harness their potential benefits for each other, we propose a new sparse Bayesian approach to jointly carry out the two important and related tasks. In our approach, we extract common latent features from different data sources by sparse projection matrices and then use the latent features to predict disease severity levels; in return, the disease status can guide the learning of sparse projection matrices, which not only reveal interactions between data sources but also select groups of related biomarkers. In order to boost the learning of sparse projection matrices, we further incorporate graph Laplacian priors encoding the valuable linkage disequilibrium (LD) information.

To address this problem, researchers have studied learning algorithms which compute posterior beliefs over a hypothesised set of policies, based on the observed actions of the other agents. The posterior belief is complemented by the prior belief, which specifies the subjective likelihood of policies before any actions are observed. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical study on the practical impact of prior beliefs over policies in repeated interactions. We show that prior beliefs can have a significant impact on the long-term performance of such methods, and that the magnitude of the impact depends on the depth of the planning horizon. Moreover, our results demonstrate that automatic methods can be used to compute prior beliefs with consistent performance effects.

277,2015,Multiagent Systems,Multi-Agent Pathfinding as a Combinatorial Auction,"Ofra Amir, Guni Sharon, Roni Stern","This paper proposes a mapping between multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and combinatorial auctions (CAs). In MAPF, agents need to reach their goal destinations without colliding. Algorithms for solving MAPF aim at assigning agents non-conflicting paths that minimize agents' travel costs. In CA problems, agents bid over bundles of items they desire. Auction mechanisms aim at finding an allocation of bundles that maximizes social welfare. In the proposed mapping of MAPF to CAs, agents bid on paths to their goals and the auction allocates non-colliding paths to the agents. Using this formulation, auction mechanisms can be naturally used to solve a range of MAPF problem variants. In particular, auction mechanisms can be applied to non-cooperative settings with self-interested agents while providing optimality guarantees and robustness to manipulations by agents. The paper further shows how to efficiently implement an auction mechanism for MAPF, utilizing methods and representations from both the MAPF and CA literatures.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9572/9496,Multi-agent pathfinding; Combinatorial auctions
278,2015,Multiagent Systems,Cooperating with Unknown Teammates in Complex Domains: A Robot Soccer Case Study of Ad Hoc Teamwork,"Samuel Barrett, Peter Stone","Many scenarios require that robots work together as a team in order to effectively accomplish their tasks. However, pre-coordinating these teams may not always be possible given the growing number of companies and research labs creating these robots. Therefore, it is desirable for robots to be able to reason about ad hoc teamwork and adapt to new teammates on the fly. Past research on ad hoc teamwork has focused on relatively simple domains, but this paper demonstrates that agents can reason about ad hoc teamwork in complex scenarios. To handle these complex scenarios, we introduce a new algorithm, PLASTIC–Policy, that builds on an existing ad hoc teamwork approach. Specifically, PLASTIC– Policy learns policies to cooperate with past teammates and reuses these policies to quickly adapt to new teammates. This approach is tested in the 2D simulation soccer league of RoboCup using the half field offense task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9631/9497,Ad hoc teamwork; Multiagent systems; Robot soccer; Reinforcement learning

Social simulations are a valuable but underutilized tool that can help public policy researchers understand when sustainable practices are likely to make the delicate transition from being an individual choice to becoming a social norm. In this paper, we introduce a new normative multi-agent architecture, Cognitive Social Learners (CSL), that models bottom-up norm emergence through a social learning mechanism, while using BDI (Belief/Desire/Intention) reasoning to handle adoption and compliance.  CSL preserves a greater sense of cognitive realism than influence propagation or infectious transmission approaches, enabling the modeling of complex beliefs and contradictory objectives within an agent-based simulation.  In this paper, we demonstrate the use of CSL for modeling norm emergence of recycling practices and public participation in a smoke-free campus initiative.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9903/9498,normative multiagent systems; social simulation; BDI architectures; social learning

Specifically, we focus on design-time verification of RMASs against rich first-order temporal properties expressed in a variant of first-order mu-calculus with quantification across states. We build on previous decidability results under the state-bounded assumption, i.e., in each single state only a bounded number of data objects is stored in the agent databases, while unboundedly many can be encountered over time. We recast this condition, showing decidability in presence of dense, linear orders, and facets defined on top of them. Our approach is based on the construction of a finite-state, sound and complete abstraction of the original system, in which dense linear orders are reformulated as non-rigid relations working on the active domain of the system only.

Although existing work mainly focus on the design-time development of static commitment protocols, recent studies propose methods to create them dynamically at run-time with respect to the goals of the agents. These methods require agents to verify new commitment protocols taking their goals, and beliefs about the other agents’ behavior into account. Accordingly, in this paper, we first propose a probabilistic model to formally capture commitment protocols according to agents’ beliefs. Secondly, we identify a set of important properties for the verification of a new commitment protocol from an agent’s perspective and formalize these properties in our model. Thirdly, we develop probabilistic model checking algorithms with advanced reduction for efficient verification of these properties.

Specifically, we investigate a language coordination problem in which agents in a dynamic MAS construct a common lexicon in a decentralized fashion. Agent interactions are modeled using a language game where every agent repeatedly plays with its neighbors. Each agent stochastically updates its lexicons based on the utility values of the received lexicons from its immediate neighbors. We present a novel topology-aware utility computation mechanism and equip the agents with the ability to reorganize their neighborhood based on this utility estimate to expedite the convention formation process. Extensive simulation results indicate that our proposed mechanism is both effective (able to converge into a large majority convention state with more than 90\% agents sharing a high-quality lexicon) and efficient (faster) as compared to state-of-the-art approaches for social conventions in large convention spaces.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9743/9505,Convention formation; Lexicon Convention; Dynamic Networks; Scale-free Network; Small-world network; Network thinking; Link diversity

To tackle this problem, a framework called game-theoretic machine learning (GTML) was recently proposed, which first learns a Markov behavior model to characterize agents' behaviors, and then learns the optimal mechanism by simulating agents' behavior changes in response to the mechanism. While GTML has demonstrated practical success, its generalization analysis is challenging because the behavior data are non-i.i.d. and dependent on the mechanism. To address this challenge, first, we decompose the generalization error for GTML into the behavior learning error and the mechanism learning error; second, for the behavior learning error, we obtain novel non-asymptotic error bounds for both parametric and non-parametric behavior learning methods; third, for the mechanism learning error, we derive a uniform convergence bound based on a new concept called \emph{nested covering number} of the mechanism space and the generalization analysis techniques developed for mixing sequences.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9785/9508,Markov behavior model; Empirical risk minimization; Game-theoretic machine learning; Generalization analysis

In spatial domains, a key criterion for doing so may depend on distances between robots and the subtasks' locations.  This paper considers a specific such criterion, namely how to assign interchangeable robots, represented as point masses, to a set of target goal locations within an open two dimensional space such that the makespan (time for all robots to reach their target locations) is minimized while also preventing collisions among robots.  We present scaleable (computable in polynomial time) role assignment algorithms that we classify as being SCRAM (Scalable Collision-avoiding Role Assignment with Minimal-makespan).  SCRAM role assignment algorithms use a graph theoretic approach to map agents to target goal locations such that our objectives for both minimizing the makespan and avoiding agent collisions are met.   A system using SCRAM role assignment was originally designed to allow for decentralized coordination among physically realistic simulated humanoid soccer playing robots in the partially observable, non-deterministic, noisy, dynamic, and limited communication setting of the RoboCup 3D simulation league.

In a recent paper, Meir et al.[EC'14] made another step in this direction, by suggesting a behavioral game-theoretic model for voters under uncertainty. For a specific variation of best-response heuristics, they proved initial existence and convergence results in the Plurality voting system.  This paper extends the model in multiple directions, considering voters with different uncertainty levels, simultaneous strategic decisions, and a more permissive notion of best-response. It is proved that a voting equilibrium exists even in the most general case. Further, any society voting in an iterative setting is guaranteed to converge to an equilibrium.  An alternative behavior is analyzed, where voters try to minimize their worst-case regret.

Temporal constraints are expressed as time windows, within which a task must be executed. There are no restrictions on the time windows, which are allowed to overlap.  Robots model their temporal constraints using a simple temporal network, enabling them to maintain consistent schedules.  When bidding on a task, a robot takes into account its own current commitments and an optimization objective, which is to minimize the time of completion of the last task alone or in combination with minimizing the distance traveled. The algorithm works both when all the tasks are known upfront and when tasks arrive dynamically. We show the performance of the algorithm in simulation with different numbers of tasks and robots, and compare it with a baseline greedy algorithm and a state-of-the-art auction algorithm.

Payne","Within characteristic function games, agents have the option of joining one of many different coalitions, based on the utility value of each candidate coalition. However, determining this utility value can be computationally complex since the number of coalitions increases exponentially with the number of agents available. Various approaches have been proposed that mediate this problem by distributing the computational load so that each agent calculates only a subset of coalition values. However, current approaches are either highly inefficient due to redundant calculations, or make the benevolence assumption (i.e. are not suitable for adversarial environments). We introduce DCG, a novel algorithm that distributes the calculations of coalition utility values across a community of agents, such that: (i) no inter-agent communication is required; (ii) the coalition value calculations are (approximately) equally partitioned into shares, one for each agent; (iii) the utility value is calculated only once for each coalition, thus redundant calculations are eliminated; (iv) there is an equal number of operations for agents with equal sized shares; and (v) an agent is only allocated those coalitions in which it is a potential member. The DCG algorithm is presented and illustrated by means of an example. We formally prove that our approach allocates all of the coalitions to the agents, and that each coalition is assigned once and only once.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9693/9512,Coalition formation; coalition value calculations; distributed problem solving; coordination without communication; power-set distribution;

Our goal is to pick a set of K items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick K movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system). However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among the chosen, available, ones.

We prove the approach sound by providing a bound relating the quality of the function approximation and regret of the algorithm.  A corollary being that the method is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium in self-play so long as the regrets are ultimately realizable by the function approximator.  Our technique can be understood as a principled generalization of existing work onabstraction in large games; in our work, both the abstraction as well as the equilibrium are learned during self-play.

Often when two words share one or more attributes in common, they are con- nected by some semantic relations. On the other hand, if there are numerous semantic relations between two words, we can expect some of the attributes of one of the words to be inherited by the other. Motivated by this close connection between attributes and relations, given a relational graph in which words are inter-connected via numerous semantic relations, we propose a method to learn a latent representation for the individual words. The proposed method considers not only the co-occurrences of words as done by existing approaches for word representation learning, but also the semantic relations in which two words co-occur. To evaluate the accuracy of the word representations learnt using the proposed method, we use the learnt word representa- tions to solve semantic word analogy problems.

Based on this, we propose a novel neural topic model (NTM) where the representation of words and documents are efficiently and naturally combined into a uniform framework. Extending from NTM, we can easily add a label layer and propose the supervised neural topic model (sNTM) to tackle supervised tasks.

307,2015,NLP and Machine Learning,Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation Using Markov Random Field and Dependency Parser,"Devendra Singh Chaplot, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Ashwin Paranjape","Word Sense Disambiguation is a difficult problem to solve in the unsupervised setting. This is because in this setting inference becomes more dependent on the interplay between different senses in the context due to unavailability of learning resources. Using two basic ideas, sense dependency and selective dependency, we model the WSD problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Inference Query on a Markov Random Field (MRF) built using WordNet and Link Parser or Stanford Parser. To the best of our knowledge this combination of dependency and MRF is novel, and our graph-based unsupervised WSD system beats state-of-the-art system on SensEval-2, SensEval-3 and SemEval-2007 English all-words datasets while being over 35 times faster.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9684/9545,Natural Language Processing; Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation; Machine Learning; Markov Random Field; Dependency Parser; WSD; MRF
308,2015,NLP and Machine Learning,Dataless Text Classification with Descriptive LDA,"Xingyuan Chen, Yunqing Xia, Peng Jin, John Carroll","Manually labeling documents for training a text classifier is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, a classifier trained on labeled documents may suffer from overfitting and adaptability problems. Dataless text classification (DLTC) has been proposed as a solution to these problems, since it does not require labeled documents. Previous research in DLTC has used explicit semantic analysis of Wikipedia content to measure semantic distance between documents, which is in turn used to classify test documents based on nearest neighbours. The semantic-based DLTC method has a major drawback in that it relies on a large-scale, finely-compiled semantic knowledge base, which is difficult to obtain in many scenarios. In this paper we propose a novel kind of model, descriptive LDA (DescLDA), which performs DLTC with only category description words and unlabeled documents. In DescLDA, the LDA model is assembled with a describing device to infer Dirichlet priors from prior descriptive documents created with category description words. The Dirichlet priors are then used by LDA to induce category-aware latent topics from unlabeled documents. Experimental results with the 20Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets show that: (1) our DLTC method is more effective than the semantic-based DLTC baseline method; and (2) the accuracy of our DLTC method is very close to state-of-the-art supervised text classification methods. As neither external knowledge resources nor labeled documents are required, our DLTC method is applicable to a wider range of scenarios.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9524/9546,Dataless text classification; descriptive  topic model; Dirichlet prior;

However, the number of topics and the exact topics discussed in each individual document can vary. In this paper we present a simple topic model that uses generalised Mallows models and incomplete topic orderings to incorporate this ordering regularity into the probabilistic generative process of the new model. We show how to reparameterise the new model so that a point-wise sampling algorithm from the Bayesian word segmentation literature can be used for inference. This algorithm jointly samples not only the topic orders and the topic assignments but also topic segmentations of documents. Experimental results show that our model performs significantly better than the other ordering-based topic models on nearly all the corpora that we used, and competitively with other state-of-the-art topic segmentation models on corpora that have a strong ordering regularity.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9392/9547,topic segmentation; topic model; GMM; ordering

When the model size grows with the complexity of the task, such approaches are so computationally demanding that the adoption of comprehensive models is not always viable.In this paper, a general framework aimed at minimizing this problem is proposed: multiple classifiers are stratified and dynamically invoked according to increasing levels of complexity corresponding to incrementally more expressive representation spaces.Computationally expensive inferences are thus adopted only when the classification at lower levels is too uncertain over an individual instance. The application of complex functions is thus avoided where possible, with a significant reduction of the overall costs. The proposed strategy has been integrated within two well-known algorithms:  Support Vector Machines and Passive-Aggressive Online classifier.A significant cost reduction (up to 90%), with a negligible  performance drop, is observed against two Natural Language Processing tasks, i.e. Question Classification and Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9520/9548,Kernel-based Learning; Stratified Learning; Online Learning

Smith","Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) is a lexicalized grammar formalism in which words are associated with categories that, in combination with a small universal set of rules, specify the syntactic configurations in which they may occur. Categories are selected from a large, recursively-defined set; this leads to high word-to-category ambiguity, which is one of the primary factors that make learning CCG parsers difficult, especially in the face of little data. Previous work has shown that learning sequence models for CCG tagging can be improved by using linguistically-motivated prior probability distributions over potential categories. We extend this approach to the task of learning a CCG parser from weak supervision. We present a Bayesian formulation for CCG parser induction that assumes only supervision in the form of an incomplete tag dictionary mapping some word types to sets of potential categories. Our approach outperforms a baseline model trained with uniform priors by exploiting universal, intrinsic properties of the CCG formalism to bias the model toward simpler, more cross-linguistically common categories.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9835/9549,natural language processing; machine learning; computational linguistics; parsing; grammar; ccg; combinatory categorial grammar

The method is based on maximizing information-theoretic combinations of shared contexts and is parallelizable for large-scale processing. An evaluation framework with crowd-sourced judgments is proposed and results are compared with alternate methods, demonstrating considerably superior results to the literature and to thesaurus look up for multi-word phrases.

Recently, unsupervised learning of log-linear models for word alignment has received considerable attention as it combines the merits of generative and discriminative approaches. However, a major challenge still remains: it is intractable to calculate the expectations of non-local features that are critical for capturing the divergence between natural languages. We propose a contrastive approach that aims to differentiate observed training examples from noises. It not only introduces prior knowledge to guide unsupervised learning but also cancels out partition functions. Based on the observation that the probability mass of log-linear models for word alignment is usually highly concentrated, we propose to use top-$n$ alignments to approximate the expectations with respect to posterior distributions. This allows for efficient and accurate calculation of expectations of non-local features.

In our language model, we propose a dependency-tree structure model that embeds sentence into a continuous vector space, which preserves visually grounded meanings and word order. In the visual model, we leverage deep neural networks to capture essential semantic information from videos. In the joint embedding model, we minimize the distance of the outputs of the deep video model and compositional language model in the joint space, and update these two models jointly.

In this paper, we present a Gaussian Mixture Neural Topic Model (GMNTM) which incorporates both the ordering of words and the semantic meaning of sentences into topic modeling. Specifically, we represent each topic as a cluster of multi-dimensional vectors and embed the corpus into a collection of vectors generated by the Gaussian mixture model. Each word is affected not only by its topic, but also by the embedding vector of its surrounding words and the context. The Gaussian mixture components and the topic of documents, sentences and words can be learnt jointly.

We address this limitation by modeling the geographic distributions of words over the earth's surface: we calculate the geographic profile of each word based on local spatial statistics over a set of geo-referenced language models. These geo-profiles can be further refined by combining in-domain data with background statistics from Wikipedia. Our resolver computes the overlap of all geo-profiles in a given text span; without using a gazetteer, it performs on par with existing classifiers. When combined with a gazetteer, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for two standard toponym resolution corpora (TR-CoNLL and Civil War).

In this paper, we investigate the use of social media data to identify consumption intentions for individuals. We develop a Consumption Intention Mining Model (CIMM) based on convolutional neural network (CNN), for identifying whether the user has a consumption intention. The task is domain-dependent, and learning CNN requires a large number of annotated instances, which can be available only in some domains. Hence, we investigate the possibility of transferring the CNN mid-level sentence representation learned from one domain to another by adding an adaptation layer. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CIMM, we conduct experiments on two domains. Our results show that CIMM offers a powerful paradigm for effectively identifying users’ consumption intention based on their social media data.

Semantic annotation of texts is one of the main processes that are intended to facilitate meaning-based information exchange between computational agents. However, such annotation faces several challenges such as the heterogeneity of natural language expressions, the heterogeneity of documents structure and context dependencies. While a broad range of annotation approaches rely mainly or partly on the target textual context to disambiguate the extracted entities, in this paper we present an approach that relies mainly on formalized-knowledge expressed in RDF datasets to categorize and disambiguate noun phrases. In the proposed method, we represent the reference knowledge bases as co-occurrence matrices and the disambiguation problem as a 0-1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. The proposed approach is unsupervised and can be ported to any RDF knowledge base. The system implementing this approach, called KODA, shows very promising results w.r.t. state-of-the-art annotation tools in cross-domain experimentations.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9309/9536,Semantic Annotation; Entity Linking; RDF; Open Data; Text Mining

Mendes, Daniel Gruhl, Neal Lewis","With the rise of social media, learning from informal text has become increasingly important. We present a novel semantic lexicon induction approach that is able to learn new vocabulary from social media. Our method is robust to the idiosyncrasies of informal and open-domain text corpora. Unlike previous work, it does not impose restrictions on the lexical features of candidate terms — e.g. by restricting entries to nouns or noun phrases —while still being able to accurately learn multiword phrases of variable length. Starting with a few seed terms for a semantic category, our method first explores the context around seed terms in a corpus, and identifies context patterns that are relevant to the category. These patterns are used to extract candidate terms — i.e. multiword segments that are further analyzed to ensure meaningful term boundary segmentation. We show that our approach is able to learn high quality semantic lexicons from informally written social media text of Twitter, and can achieve accuracy as high as 92% in the top 100 learned category members.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/10016/9537,lexicon induction; social media

Chinese segmentationis highly accurate on news data, but the accuraciesdrop significantly on other domains, such as science andliterature. For scientific domains, a significant portionof out-of-vocabulary words are domain-specific terms, and therefore lexicons can be used to improve segmentationsignificantly. For the literature domain, however,there is not a fixed set of domain terms. For example,each novel can contain a specifiac set of person, organizationand location names. We investigate a method forautomatically mining common noun entities for eachnovel using information extraction techniques, and usethe resulting entities to improve a state-of-the-art segmentationmodel for the novel. In particular, we designa novel double-propagation algorithm that mines nounentities together with common contextual patterns, anduse them as plug-in features to a model trained on thesource domain. An advantage of our method is that noretraining for the segmentation model is needed for eachnovel, and hence it can be applied efficiently given thehuge number of novels on the web.

On the contrary, social media such as Twitter provide abundance of data, in a timely manner: information spreads at an incredible pace and is posted long before it makes it into more commonly used resources for knowledge extraction. In this paper we address the question whether we can exploit social media to extract new facts, which may at first seem like finding needles in haystacks. We collect tweets about 60 entities in Freebase and compare four methods to extract binary relation candidates, based on syntactic and semantic parsing and simple mechanism for factuality scoring. The extracted facts are manually evaluated in terms of their correctness and relevance for search. We show that moving from bottom-up syntactic or semantic dependency parsing formalisms to top-down frame-semantic processing improves the robustness of knowledge extraction, producing more intelligible fact candidates of better quality.

However, sometimes we are so eager to make a citation of quote somewhere, but have no idea about the relevant quote to express our idea. Because knowing or remembering so many quotes is not easy, it is exciting to have a system to recommend relevant quotes for us while writing.

Our methods outperform the existing methods in several scenarios; our filtering method achieves the highest F1 and precision on forum posts, and our CRF method achieves the highest precision on tweets. Furthermore, we address the difficulty of annotating social media on a large scale with an alternate evaluation scheme that takes advantage of the ADRs listed on drug labels.

However, since there is no control on how users can publish messages on Twitter, finding newsworthy events from Twitter becomes a difficult task like ""finding a needle in a haystack"". In this paper we propose a general unsupervised framework to explore events from tweets, which consists of a pipeline process of filtering, extraction and categorization. To filter out noisy tweets, the filtering step exploits a lexicon-based approach to separate tweets that are event-related from those that are not. Then, based on these event-related tweets, the structured representations of events are extracted and categorized automatically using an unsupervised Bayesian model without the use of any labelled data. Moreover, the categorized events are assigned with the event type labels without human intervention. The proposed framework has been evaluated on over 60 millions tweets which were collected for one month in December 2010. A precision of 70.49% is achieved in event extraction, outperforming a competitive baseline by nearly 6%. Events are also clustered into coherence groups with the automatically assigned event type label.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9413/9542,

Covariate shift, a primary assumption in several works on domain adaptation, assumes that the labeling functions of source and target domains are identical. We present a domain adaptation algorithm that assumes a relaxed version of covariate shift where the assumption that the labeling functions of the source and target domains are identical holds with a certain probability. Assuming a source deterministic large margin binary classifier, the farther a target instance is from the source decision boundary, the higher the probability that covariate shift holds. In this context, given a target unlabeled sample and no target labeled data, we develop a domain adaptation algorithm that bases its labeling decisions both on the source learner and on the similarities between the target unlabeled instances. The source labeling function decisions associated with probabilistic covariate shift, along with the target similarities are concurrently expressed on a similarity graph. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on a benchmark sentiment analysis (and domain adaptation) dataset, where state-of-the-art adaptation results are achieved.

One of the fundamental branches of active learning is query synthesis, where the learning agent constructs artificial queries from scratch in order to reveal sensitive information about the true decision boundary. Nevertheless, the existing literature on membership query synthesis has focused on finite concept classes with a limited extension to real-world applications. In this paper, we present an efficient spectral algorithm for membership query synthesis for halfspaces, whose sample complexity is experimentally shown to be near-optimal. At each iteration, the algorithm consists of two steps. First, a convex optimization problem is solved that provides an approximate characterization of the version space. Second, a principal component is extracted, which yields a synthetic query that shrinks the version space exponentially fast. Unlike traditional methods in active learning, the proposed method can be readily extended into the batch setting by solving for the top k eigenvectors in the second step. Experimentally, it exhibits a significant improvement over traditional approaches such as uncertainty sampling and representative sampling. For example, to learn a halfspace in the Euclidean plane with 25 dimensions and an estimation error of 1E-4, the proposed algorithm uses less than 3% of the number of queries required by uncertainty sampling.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9434/9876,Active Learning; Query Synthesis; Halfspace; Linear Classifiers

In this paper we propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach for continuous environments with constraints. The approach combines model-based reinforcement learning with recent advances in approximate optimal control. This results in a bounded-rationality agent that makes decisions in real-time by efficiently solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems on learned sparse Gaussian process models. Such a combination has several advantages. No high-dimensional policy needs to be computed or stored while the learning problem often reduces to a set of lower-dimensional models of the dynamics. In addition, hard constraints can easily be included and objectives can also be changed in real-time to allow for multiple or dynamic tasks.

However, there are currently no general methods to learn an inter-task mapping without requiring either background knowledge that is not typically present in RL settings, or an expensive analysis of an exponential number of inter-task mappings in the size of the state and action spaces.

This is indeed very difficult as  complex hidden coupling relationships exist between different financial markets in various countries, which are very hard to model. The couplings involve interactions between homogeneous markets from various countries (we call intra-market coupling), interactions between heterogeneous markets (inter-market coupling) and interactions between current and past market behaviors (temporal coupling). Very limited work has been done towards modeling such complex couplings, whereas some existing methods predict market movement by simply aggregating indicators from various markets but ignoring the inbuilt couplings. As a result, these methods are highly sensitive to observations, and may often fail when financial indicators  change slightly. In this paper, a coupled deep belief network is designed to accommodate the above three types of couplings across financial markets. With a deep-architecture model to capture the high-level coupled features, the proposed approach can infer market trends.

Thus, applying manifold information obtained from the original space to the clustering process in a low-dimensional subspace is prone to inferior performance. Aiming to address this issue, we propose a novel convex algorithm that mines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional subspace. In addition, our unified learning process makes the manifold learning particularly tailored for the clustering. Compared with other related methods, the proposed algorithm results in more structured clustering result.

Unlike traditional batch learning methods for maximizing AUC which often suffer from poor scalability, recent years have witnessed some emerging studies that attempt to maximize AUC by single-pass online learning approaches. Despite their encouraging results reported, the existing online AUC maximization algorithms often adopt simple stochastic gradient descent approaches, which fail to exploit the geometry knowledge of the data observed in the online learning process, and thus could suffer from relatively slow convergence. To overcome the limitation of the existing studies, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm of Adaptive Online AUC Maximization (AdaOAM), by applying an adaptive gradient method for exploiting the knowledge of historical gradients to perform more informative online learning. The new adaptive updating strategy by AdaOAM is less sensitive to parameter settings due to its natural effect of tuning the learning rate. In addition, the time complexity of the new algorithm remains the same as the previous non-adaptive algorithms.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel GGM structure learning method that exploits the fact that for many real-world problems we have prior knowledge that certain edges are unlikely to be present. For example, in gene regulatory networks, a pair of genes that does not participate together in any of the cellular processes, typically referred to as pathways, is less likely to be connected. In computer vision applications in which each variable corresponds to a pixel, each variable is likely to be connected to the nearby variables. In this paper, we propose the pathway graphical lasso, which learns the structure of a GGM subject to pathway-based constraints. In order to solve this problem, we decompose the network into smaller parts, and use a message-passing algorithm in order to communicate among the subnetworks. Our algorithm has orders of magnitude improvement in run time compared to the state-of-the-art optimization methods for the graphical lasso problem that were modified to handle pathway-based constraints.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9954/9918,"structure learning, graphical models, computational biology, model decomposition"

Building on the efficient exploration RL literature, we introduce two new concurrent RL algorithms and bound their sample complexity. We show that under some mild conditions, both when the agent is known to be acting in many copies of the same MDP, and when they are not the same but are taken from a finite set, we can gain linear improvements in the sample complexity over not sharing information. This is quite exciting as a linear speedup is the most one might hope to gain.

364,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Discriminative Feature Grouping,"Lei Han, Yu Zhang","Feature grouping has been demonstrated to be promising in learning with high-dimensional data. It helps reduce the variances in the estimation and improves the stability of feature selection. One major limitation of existing feature grouping approaches is that some similar but different feature groups are often mis-fused, leading to impaired performance. In this paper, we propose a Discriminative Feature Grouping (DFG) method to discover the feature groups with enhanced discrimination. Different from existing methods, DFG adopts a novel regularizer for the feature coefficients to trade-off between fusing and discriminating feature groups. The proposed regularizer consists of a ell_1 norm to enforce feature sparsity and a pairwise ell_infty norm to encourage the absolute differences among any three feature coefficients to be similar. To achieve better asymptotic property, we generalize the proposed regularizer to an adaptive one where the feature coefficients are weighted based on the solution of some estimator with root-n consistency. For optimization, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the proposed methods efficiently. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods have good performance compared with the state-of-the-art feature grouping methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9509/9920,Feature Selection; Feature Grouping
365,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Learning Multi-Level Task Groups in Multi-Task Learning,"Lei Han, Yu Zhang","In multi-task learning (MTL), multiple related tasks are learned jointly by sharing information across them. Many MTL algorithms have been proposed to learn the underlying task groups. However, those methods are limited to learn the task groups at only a single level, which may be not sufficient to model the complex structure among tasks in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Task Grouping (MeTaG) method to learn the multi-level grouping structure instead of only one level among tasks. Specifically, by assuming the number of levels to be H, we decompose the parameter matrix into a sum of H component matrices, each of which is regularized with a l2 norm on the pairwise difference among parameters of all the tasks to construct level-specific task groups. For optimization, we employ the smoothing proximal gradient method to efficiently solve the objective function of the MeTaG model. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis to show that under certain conditions the MeTaG model can recover the true parameter matrix and the true task groups in each level with high probability. We experiment our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing competitive performance over state-of-the-art MTL methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9510/9921,Multi-Task Learning; Task Grouping; Multi-Level

In this paper, we address a different type of hubness that occurs when the number of samples is large. We investigate the difference between the hubness in high-dimensional data and the one in large-sample data. One finding is that centering, which is known to reduce the former, does not work for the latter. We then propose a new hub-reduction method, called localized centering. It is an extension of centering, yet works effectively for both types of hubness.

Currently, most pool-based active learning strategies are constructed based on some human-designed philosophy; that is, they reflect what human beings assume to be “good labeling questions.” However, while such human-designed philosophies can be useful on specific data sets, it is often difficult to establish the theoretical connection of those philosophies to the true learning performance of interest. In addition, given that a single human-designed philosophy is unlikely to work on all scenarios, choosing and blending those strategies under different scenarios is an important but challenging practical task. This paper tackles this task by letting the machines adaptively “learn” from the performance of a set of given strategies on a particular data set. More specifically, we design a learning algorithm that connects active learning with the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. Further, we postulate that, given an appropriate choice for the multi-armed bandit learner, it is possible to estimate the performance of different strategies on the fly. Extensive empirical studies of the resulting ALBL algorithm confirm that it performs better than state-of-the-art strategies and a leading blending algorithm for active learning, all of which are based on human-designed philosophy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9636/9924,active learning; machine learning

To tackle this problem, we propose a kernelized online imbalanced learning (KOIL) algorithm to directly maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC).  We address two more challenges: 1) How to control the number of support vectors without sacrificing model performance; and 2) how to restrict the fluctuation of the learned decision function to attain smooth updating.  To this end, we introduce two buffers with fixed budgets (buffer sizes) for positive class and negative class, respectively, to store the learned support vectors, which can allow us to capture the global information of the decision boundary.  When determining the weight of a new support vector, we confine its influence only to its $k$-nearest opposite support vectors.  This can restrict the effect of new instances and prevent the harm of outliers.  More importantly, we design a sophisticated scheme to compensate the model after replacement is conducted when either buffer is full.  With this compensation, the learned model approaches the one learned with infinite budgets.  We present both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental comparison to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed KOIL.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9578/9925,

To enable inference in very large state spaces, we introduce an approximate MaxEnt IOC procedure to address the fundamental computational bottleneck stemming from calculating the partition function via dynamic programming. Approximate MaxEnt IOC is based on two components: approximate dynamic programming and Monte Carlo sampling. We analyze this approximation approach and provide a finite-sample error upper bound on its excess loss. We validate the proposed method in the context of analyzing dual-agent interactions from video, where we use approximate MaxEnt IOC to simulate mental images of a single agents body pose sequence (a high-dimensional image space).

Thus we define a novel metric to evaluate the quality of a clustering labeling, named Minimum Separation Probability (MSP), which is a lower bound of the generalization accuracy of a classifier learnt from the clustering labeling. We take MSP as the objective to maximize and propose our approach Maximin Separation Probability Clustering (MSPC), which has several attractive properties, such as invariance to anisotropic feature scaling and intuitive probabilistic explanation for clustering quality. We present three efficient optimization strategies for MSPC, and analyze their interesting connections to existing clustering approaches, such as maximum margin clustering (MMC) and discriminative k-means.

Hauptmann","Curriculum learning (CL) or self-paced learning (SPL) represents a recently proposed learning regime inspired by the learning process of humans and animals that gradually proceeds from easy to more complex samples in training. The two methods share a similar conceptual learning paradigm, but differ in specific learning schemes. In CL, the curriculum is predetermined by prior knowledge, and remain fixed thereafter. Therefore, this type of method heavily relies on the quality of prior knowledge while ignoring feedback about the learner. In SPL, the curriculum is dynamically determined to adjust to the learning pace of the leaner. However, SPL is unable to deal with prior knowledge, rendering it prone to overfitting. In this paper, we discover the missing link between CL and SPL, and propose a unified framework named self-paced curriculum leaning (SPCL). SPCL is formulated as a concise optimization problem that takes into account both prior knowledge known before training and the learning progress during training. In comparison to human education, SPCL is analogous to ""instructor-student-collaborative"" learning mode, as opposed to ""instructor-driven"" in CL or ""student-driven"" in SPL.

We study improving the computational complexity of such algorithms by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) type schemes in place of classic regression solvers. We show that SGD schemes efficiently track the true solutions of the regression problems, even in the presence of a drift. This finding coupled with an $O(d)$ improvement in complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the data, make them attractive for implementation in the \textit{big data} settings. In the case when strong convexity in the regression problem is guaranteed, we provide bounds on the error both in expectation and high probability (the latter is often needed to provide theoretical guarantees for higher level algorithms), despite the drifting least squares solution. As an example of this case we prove that the regret performance of an SGD version of the PEGE linear bandit algorithm is worse than that of PEGE itself only by a factor of $O(\log^4 n)$.   When strong convexity of the regression problem cannot be guaranteed, we investigate using an adaptive regularisation.

If a practitioner selects finite sets of tests and histories that are known to be sufficient to completely capture the system, an exact PSR can be learned in polynomial time using spectral methods.  However, most real-world systems are complex, and in practice computational constraints limit us to small sets of tests and histories which are therefore never truly sufficient. How, then, should we choose these sets?  Existing theory offers little guidance here, and yet we show that the choice is highly consequential -- tests and histories selected at random or by a naive rule significantly underperform the best sets.  In this paper we approach the problem both theoretically and empirically. While any fixed system can be represented by an infinite number of equivalent but distinct PSRs, we show that in the computationally unconstrained setting, where existing theory guarantees accurate predictions, the PSRs learned by spectral methods always satisfy a particular spectral bound.  Adapting this idea, we propose a simple algorithmic technique to search for sets of tests and histories that approximately satisfy the bound while respecting computational limits.

However, conventional algorithms to solve MDP are computationally infeasible in this scenario. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods tackle this issue by computing approximate solutions. A widely applied ADP method is approximate linear program (ALP) which makes use of linear function approximation and offers theoretical performance guarantees. Nevertheless, the ALP is difficult to solve due to the presence of a large number of constraints and in practice, a reduced linear program (RLP) is solved instead. The RLP has a tractable number of constraints sampled from the original constraints of the ALP. Though the RLP is known to perform well in experiments, theoretical guarantees are available only for a specific RLP obtained under idealized assumptions. In this paper, we generalize the RLP to define a generalized reduced linear program (GRLP) which has a tractable number of constraints that are obtained as positive linear combinations of the original constraints of the ALP. The main contribution of this paper is the novel theoretical framework developed to obtain error bounds for any given GRLP. Central to our framework are two max-norm contraction operators. Our result theoretically justifies linear approximation of constraints. We discuss the implication of our results in the contexts of ADP and reinforcement learning.

In many real-world applications, data can be represented in various heterogeneous features or views. Different views often provide different aspects of information that are complementary to each other. Several previous methods of clustering have demonstrated that better accuracy can be achieved using integrated information of all the views than just using each view individually. One important class of such methods is multi-view spectral clustering, which is based on graph Laplacian. However, existing methods are not applicable to large-scale problem for their high computational complexity. To this end, we propose a novel large-scale multi-view spectral clustering approach based on the bipartite graph. Our method uses local manifold fusion to integrate heterogeneous features.

Recently, matrix completion (MC) has been developed to deal with multi-label classification tasks. MC has distinct advantages, such as robustness to missing entries in the feature and label spaces and a natural ability to handle multi-label problems. However, current MC-based multi-label image classification methods only consider data represented by a single-view feature, therefore, do not precisely characterize images that contain several semantic concepts. An intuitive way to utilize multiple features taken from different views is to concatenate the different features into a long vector; however, this concatenation is prone to over-fitting and leads to high time complexity in MC-based image classification. Therefore, we present a novel multi-view learning model for MC-based image classification, called low-rank multi-view matrix completion (lrMMC), which first seeks a low-dimensional common representation of all views by utilizing the proposed low-rank multi-view learning (lrMVL) algorithm. In lrMVL, the common subspace is constrained to be low rank so that it is suitable for MC. In addition, combination weights are learned to explore complementarity between different views. An efficient solver based on fixed-point continuation (FPC) is developed for optimization, and the learned low-rank representation is then incorporated into MC-based image classification.

To reduce expensive costs brought in by increasing dimensionality,  low-rank metric learning arises as it can be more economical in storage and computation.  However, existing low-rank metric learning algorithms usually adopt nonconvex objectives,  and are hence sensitive to the choice of a heuristic low-rank basis. In this paper, we propose  a novel low-rank metric learning algorithm to yield bilinear similarity functions.  This algorithm scales linearly with input dimensionality in both space and time,  therefore applicable to high-dimensional data domains.  A convex objective free of heuristics is formulated by leveraging trace norm regularization to promote low-rankness.  Crucially, we  prove that all globally optimal metric solutions must retain a certain low-rank structure,  which enables our algorithm to decompose the high-dimensional learning task into two steps:  an SVD-based projection and a metric learning problem with reduced dimensionality.

Different from existing approaches where missing channels are firstly imputed and then a standard MKL algorithm is deployed on the imputed data, our algorithm directly classifies each sample with its observed channels. In specific, we define a margin for each sample in its own relevant space, which corresponds to the observed channels of that sample. The proposed AMKL algorithm then maximizes the minimum of all sample-based margins, and this leads to a difficult optimization problem. We show that this problem can be reformulated as a convex one by applying the representer theorem. This makes it readily be solved via existing convex optimization packages. Extensive experiments are conducted on five MKL benchmark data sets to compare the proposed algorithm with existing imputation-based methods. As observed, our algorithm achieves superior performance and the improvement is more significant with the increasing missing ratio.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9298/9945,"Multiple Kernel Learning, Absent Feature Learning, Max Margin"
390,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Eigenvalues Ratio for Kernel Selection of Kernel Methods,"Yong Liu, Shizhong Liao","The selection of kernel function which determines the mapping between the input space and the feature space is of crucial importance to kernel methods. Existing kernel selection approaches commonly use some measures of generalization error, which are usually difficult to estimate and have slow convergence rates. In this paper, we propose a novel measure, called eigenvalues ratio (ER), of the tight bound of generalization error for kernel selection. ER is the ration between the sum of the main eigenvalues and that of the tail eigenvalues of the kernel matrix. Defferent from most of existing measures, ER is defined on the kernel matrxi, so it can be estimated easily from the available training data, which makes it usable for kernel selection. We establish tight ER-based generalization error bounds of order $O(\frac{1}{n})$ for several kernel-based methods under certain general conditions, while for most of existing measures, the convergence rate is at most $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$. Finally, to guarantee good generalization performance, we propose a novel kernel selection criterion by minimizing the derived tight generalization error bounds. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our kernel selection criterion is a good choice for kernel seletion.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9377/9946,kernel selection; matrix spectra; error bound
391,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Parallel Gaussian Process Regression for Big Data: Low-Rank Representation Meets Markov Approximation,"Kian Hsiang Low, Jiangbo Yu, Jie Chen, Patrick Jaillet","The expressive power of a Gaussian process (GP) model comes at a cost of poor scalability in the data size. To improve its scalability, this paper presents a low-rank-cum-Markov approximation (LMA) of the GP model that is novel in leveraging the dual computational advantages stemming from complementing a low-rank approximate representation of the full-rank GP based on a support set of inputs with a Markov approximation of the resulting residual process; the latter approximation is guaranteed to be closest in the Kullback-Leibler distance criterion subject to some constraint and is considerably more refined than that of existing sparse GP models utilizing low-rank representations due to its more relaxed conditional independence assumption (especially with larger data). As a result, our LMA method can trade off between the size of the support set and the order of the Markov property to (a) incur lower computational cost than such sparse GP models while achieving predictive performance comparable to them and (b) accurately represent features/patterns of any scale. Interestingly, varying the Markov order produces a spectrum of LMAs with PIC approximation and full-rank GP at the two extremes. An advantage of our LMA method is that it is amenable to parallelization on multiple machines/cores, thereby gaining greater scalability. Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets in clusters of up to 32 computing nodes shows that our centralized and parallel LMA methods are significantly more time-efficient and scalable than state-of-the-art sparse and full-rank GP regression methods while achieving comparable predictive performances.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9496/9947,Gaussian process; parallel machine learning; scalability; big data

By giving an L1-norm formulation of Laplacian regularization directly based upon the manifold structure of the data, we transform noise-robust semi-supervised learning into a generalized sparse coding problem so that noise reduction can be imposed upon the noisy initial labels. Furthermore, to keep the scalability of noise-robust semi-supervised learning over very large data, we make use of both nonlinear approximation and dimension reduction techniques to solve this generalized sparse coding problem in linear time and space complexity. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm in the challenging task of large-scale semi-supervised image classification with only few noisy initial labels.

However, in many cases the groups themselves are also in latent groups (categories) which may impact the modeling a lot. In order to utilize the unknown category information of grouped data, we present the hybrid nested/ hierarchical Dirichlet process (hNHDP), a prior that blends the desirable aspects of both the HDP and the nested Dirichlet Process (NDP). Specifically, we introduce a clustering structure for the groups. The prior distribution for each cluster is a realization of a Dirichlet process. Moreover, the set of cluster-specific distributions can share part of atoms between groups, and the shared atoms and specific atoms are generated separately. We apply the hNHDP to document modeling and bring in a mechanism to identify discriminative words and topics.

A key feature of layered learning is that higher layers directly depend on the learned lower layers.  In its original formulation, lower layers were frozen prior to learning higher layers.  This paper considers an extension to the paradigm that allows learning certain behaviors independently, and then later stitching them together by learning at the ""seams"" where their influences overlap.  The UT Austin Villa 2014 RoboCup 3D simulation team, using such overlapping layered learning, learned a total of 19 layered behaviors for a simulated soccer-playing robot, organized both in series and in parallel.  To the best of our knowledge this is more than three times the number of layered behaviors in any prior layered learning system.  Furthermore, the complete learning process is repeated on four different robot body types, showcasing its generality as a paradigm for efficient behavior learning.  The resulting team won the RoboCup 2014 championship with an undefeated record, scoring 52 goals and conceding none.

However, real-world problems often differ from the standard formulation in several ways. First, feedback may be delayed instead of arriving immediately. Second, the real world often contains structure which suggests heuristics, which we wish to incorporate while retaining the best-known theoretical guarantees. Third, we may wish to make use of an arbitrary prior dataset without negatively impacting performance. Fourth, we may wish to efficiently evaluate algorithms using a previously collected dataset. Surprisingly, these seemingly-disparate problems can be addressed using algorithms inspired by a recently-developed queueing technique. We present the Stochastic Delayed Bandits (SDB) algorithm as a solution to these four problems, which takes black-box bandit algorithms (including heuristic approaches) as input while achieving good theoretical guarantees. We present empirical results from both synthetic simulations and real-world data drawn from an educational game.

We present V-MIN, an algorithm that integrates teacher demonstrations with RL to learn complex tasks faster. The algorithm combines active demonstration requests and autonomous exploration to find policies yielding rewards higher than a given threshold Vmin. This threshold sets the degree of quality with which the robot is expected to complete the task, thus allowing the user to either opt for very good policies that require many learning experiences, or to be more permissive with sub-optimal policies that are easier to learn. The threshold can also be increased online to force the system to improve its policies until the desired behavior is obtained. Furthermore, the algorithm generalizes previously learned knowledge, adapting well to changes. The performance of V-MIN has been validated through experimentation, including domains from the international planning competition.

Few instance-based algorithms have this property while being simultaneously fast, which the BF is. This is crucial for applications where one needs to respond to input data in real time. The number of chil- dren of each node is not set beforehand but obtained from the training procedure, which makes the algorithm very flexible with regards to what data manifolds it can learn. We test its generalization performance and speed on a range of benchmark datasets and detail in which settings it outperforms the state of the art.

In such attacks an attacker contaminates the training data so that a specific learning algorithm would produce a model profitable to the attacker. Understanding training-set attacks is important as more intelligent agents (e.g. spam filters and robots) are equipped with learning capability and can potentially be hacked via data they receive from the environment. This paper identifies the optimal training-set attack on a broad family of machine learners. First we show that optimal training-set attack can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. Then we show that for machine learners with certain Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions we can solve the bilevel problem efficiently using gradient methods on an implicit function. As examples, we demonstrate optimal training-set attacks on Support VectorMachines, logistic regression, and linear regression with extensive experiments.

400,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Tensor-Variate Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"Tu Dinh Nguyen, Truyen Tran, Dinh Phung, Svetha Venkatesh","Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are an important class of latent variable models for representing vector data. An under-explored area is multimode data, where each data point is a matrix or a tensor. Standard RBMs applying to such data would require vectorizing matrices and tensors, thus resulting in unnecessarily high dimensionality and at the same time, destroying the inherent higher-order interaction structures. This paper introduces Tensor-variate Restricted Boltzmann Machines (TvRBMs) which generalize RBMs to capture the multiplicative interaction between data modes and the latent variables. TvRBMs are highly compact in that the number of free parameters grows only linear with the number of modes. We demonstrate the capacity of TvRBMs on three real-world applications: handwritten digit classification, face recognition and EEG-based alcoholic diagnosis.

Most of the existing hashing methods focus on mapping low-level features to binary codes, but neglect attributes that are commonly associated with data samples. Attribute data, such as image tag, product brand, and user profile, can represent human recognition better than low-level features. However, attributes have specific characteristics, including high-dimensional, sparse and categorical properties, which is hardly leveraged into the existing hashing learning frameworks. In this paper, we propose a hashing learning framework, Probabilistic Attributed Hashing (PAH), to integrate attributes with low-level features. The connections between attributes and low-level features are built through sharing a common set of latent binary variables, i.e. hash codes, through which attributes and features can complement each other. Finally, we develop an efficient iterative learning algorithm, which is generally feasible for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments and comparison study are conducted on two public datasets, i.e., DBLP and NUS-WIDE.

However, the dynamic, non-stationary nature, and effectively infinite length of data streams pose additional challenges for stream data mining algorithms. The sparse quantity of training data also limits the use of algorithms that are heavily dependent on supervised training. To address all these issues, we propose an incremental semi-supervised method that provides general concept class label predictions, but it also tracks concept clusters within the feature space using an innovative new online clustering algorithm. Each concept cluster contains an embedded stream classifier, creating a diverse ensemble for data instance classification within the generative model used for detecting emerging concepts in the stream.

An important task in analyzing such evolving networks is change-point detection, in which we both identify the times at which the large-scale pattern of interactions changes fundamentally and quantify how large and what kind of change occurred. Here, we formalize for the first time the network change-point detection problem within an online probabilistic learning framework and introduce a method that can reliably solve it. This method combines a generalized hierarchical random graph model with a Bayesian hypothesis test to quantitatively determine if, when, and precisely how a change point has occurred. We analyze the detectability of our method using synthetic data with known change points of different types and magnitudes, and show that this method is more accurate than several previously used alternatives.

405,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Adaptive Sampling with Optimal Cost for Class-Imbalance Learning,Yuxin Peng,"Learning from imbalanced data sets is one of the challenging problems in machine learning, which means the number of negative examples is far more than that of positive examples. The main problems of existing methods are: (1) The degree of re-sampling, a key factor greatly affecting performance, needs to be pre-fixed, which is difficult to make the optimal choice; (2) Many useful negative samples are discarded in under-sampling; (3) The effectiveness of algorithm-level methods are limited because they just use the original training data for single classifier. To address the above issues, a novel approach of adaptive sampling with optimal cost is proposed for class-imbalance learning in this paper. The novelty of the proposed approach mainly lies in: adaptively over-sampling the minority positive examples and under-sampling the majority negative examples, forming different sub-classifiers by different subsets of training data with the best cost ratio adaptively chosen, and combining these sub-classifiers according to their accuracy to create a strong classifier. It aims to make full use of the whole training data and improve the performance of class-imbalance learning classifier.

Most previous ensemble pruning approaches solve objectives that mix the two goals. In this paper, motivated by the recent theoretical advance of evolutionary optimization, we investigate solving the two goals explicitly in a bi-objective formulation and propose the PEP (Pareto Ensemble Pruning) approach.

Subtyping research seeks to refine the definition of such complex, multi-organ diseases by identifying homogeneous patient subgroups. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Subtyping Model (PSM) to identify subgroups based on clustering individual clinical severity markers. This task is challenging due to the presence of nuisance variability — variations in measurements that are not due to disease subtype — which, if not accounted for, generate biased estimates for the group-level trajectories. Measurement sparsity and irregular sampling patterns pose additional challenges in clustering such data. PSM uses a hierarchical model to account for these different sources of variability.

Allebach","As one of the most important state-of-the-art classification techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been widely adopted in many real-world applications, such as object detection, face recognition, text categorization, etc., due to its competitive practical performance and elegant theoretical interpretation. However, it treats all samples independently, and ignores the fact that, in many real situations especially when data are in high dimensional space, samples typically lie on low dimensional manifolds of the feature space and thus a sample can be related to its neighbors by being represented as a linear combination of other samples on the same manifold. This linear representation, which is usually sparse, reflects the structure of underlying manifolds. It has been extensively explored in the recent literature and proven to be critical for the performance of classification. To benefit from both the underlying low dimensional manifold structure and the large margin classifier, this paper proposes a novel method called Sparsity Preserving Support Vector Machine(SP-SVM), which explicitly considers the sparse representation of samples while maximizing the margin between different classes. Consequently, SP-SVM inherits both the discriminative power of support vector machine and the merits of sparsity. A set of experiments on real-world benchmark data sets show that SP-SVM achieves significantly higher precision on recognition task than various competitive baselines including the traditional SVM, the sparse representation based method and the classical nearest neighbor classifier.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9763/9967,SVM; sparse representation; manifold learning; face recognition; image classification

In this paper, we provide a text label refinement algorithm to adjust the labels for such noisy and missing labeled datasets. We assume that the labeled sets can be refined based on the labels with certain confidence, and the similarity between data being consistent with the labels.

Thus DDFA features are inherently discriminative from the start even though they are trained without knowledge of the ultimate classification problem. Interestingly, DDFA also continues to add new features indefinitely (so it does not depend on a hidden layer size), is not based on minimizing error, and is inherently divergent instead of convergent, thereby providing a unique direction of research for unsupervised feature learning.

In this paper we propose an off-policy method for computing a lower confidence bound on the expected return of a policy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/10042/9973,policy evaluation; high-confidence; concentration inequality
417,2015,Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,TODTLER: Two-Order-Deep Transfer Learning,"Jan Van Haaren, Andrey Kolobov, Jesse Davis","The traditional way of obtaining models from data, inductive learning, has proved itself both in theory and in many practical applications. However, in domains where data is difficult or expensive to obtain, e.g., medicine, deep transfer learning is a more promising technique. It circumvents the model acquisition difficulties caused by scarce data in a target domain by carrying over structural properties of a model learned in a source domain where training data is ample. Nonetheless, the lack of a principled view of transfer learning so far has limited its adoption. In this paper, we address this issue by regarding transfer learning as a process that biases learning in a target domain in favor of patterns useful in a source domain. Specifically, we consider a first-order logic model of the data as an instantiation of a set of second-order templates. Hence, the usefulness of a model is partly determined by the learner's prior distribution over these template sets. The main insight of our work is that transferring knowledge amounts to acquiring a posterior over the second-order template sets by learning in the source domain and using this posterior when learning in the target setting. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates our approach to outperform the existing transfer learning techniques in terms of accuracy and runtime.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9851/9974,Transfer learning

Under appropriate stationarity and ergodicity conditions, we show that the use of a sufficiently powerful model gives rise to a consistent value function estimator. We also study the behavior of this technique when applied to various Atari 2600 video games, where the use of suboptimal modeling techniques is unavoidable. We consider three fundamentally different models, all too limited to perfectly model the dynamics of the system. Remarkably, we find that our technique provides sufficiently accurate value estimates for effective on-policy control.

Andrew Bagnell","Most typical statistical and machine learning approaches to time series modeling optimize a single-step prediction error. In multiple-step simulation, the learned model is iteratively applied, feeding through the previous output as its new input. Any such predictor however, inevitably introduces errors, and these compounding errors change the input distribution for future prediction steps, breaking the train-test i.i.d assumption common in supervised learning. We present an approach that reuses training data to make a no-regret learner robust to errors made during multi-step prediction.  Our insight is to formulate the problem as imitation learning; the training data serves as a ""demonstrator"" by providing corrections for the errors made during multi-step prediction. By this reduction of multi-step time series prediction to imitation learning, we establish theoretically a strong performance guarantee on the relation between training error and the multi-step prediction error. We present experimental results of our method, DaD, and show significant improvement over the traditional approach in two notably different domains, dynamic system modeling and video texture prediction.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9592/9976,Time series modeling; Learning dynamics models; Imitation learning; Cascading predictions; Meta-Algorithms

The sparsity constraints in the existing methods are usually specified by users and are independent of the input data. However, the input data could be heterogeneous in content and thus naturally demand elastic and adaptive settings of the sparsity constraints. To solve this problem, we proposed a generalized model with adaptive sparsity constraint, named Gaussian Cardinality Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GC-RBM). In this model, the thresholds of hidden unit activations are decided by the input data and a given Gaussian distribution on the pre-training phase.

Yet most existing approaches are studied in an offline fashion, implicitly assuming that data from different domains are given as a batch. Such an assumption is not valid in many real-world applications where data samples arrive sequentially, and one wants a good learner even from few examples.  The goal of our work is to provide sound extensions to existing transfer and multitask learning algorithms such that they can be used in an anytime setting. More specifically, we propose two novel online boosting algorithms, one for transfer learning and one for multitask learning, both designed to leverage the knowledge of instances in other domains.

Recently, batch mode active learning, which selects a batch of samples to label in parallel, has attracted a lot of attention. Its challenge lies in the choice of criteria used for guiding the search of the optimal batch. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to selecting the optimal batch of queries by minimizing the α-relative Pearson divergence (RPE) between the labeled and the original datasets. This particular divergence is chosen since it can distinguish the optimal batch more easily than other measures especially when available candidates are similar. The proposed objective is a min-max optimization problem, and it is difficult to solve due to the involvement of both minimization and maximization. We find that the objective has an equivalent convex form, and thus a global optimal solution can be obtained. Then the subgradient method can be applied to solve the simplified convex problem.

Since tagging information is usually very sparse, effective learning of the content representation for these resources is  crucial to accurate tag recommendation.  Recently, models proposed for tag recommendation, such as collaborative topic regression and its variants, have demonstrated promising accuracy.  However, a limitation of these models is that, by using topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation as the key component, the learned representation may not be compact and effective enough.  Moreover, since relational data exist as an auxiliary data source in many applications, it is desirable to incorporate such data into tag recommendation models.  In this paper, we start with a deep learning model called stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) in an attempt to learn more effective content representation.  We propose a probabilistic formulation for SDAE and then extend it to a relational SDAE (RSDAE) model.  RSDAE jointly performs deep representation learning and relational learning in a principled way under a probabilistic framework.

Since squared L2-norm distance is prone to outliers, it is desirable to develop a robust LPP method. In this paper, motivated by existing studies that improve the robustness of statistical learning models via L1-norm or not-squared L2-norm formulations, we propose a robust LPP (rLPP) formulation to minimize the p-th order of the L2-norm distances, which can better tolerate large outlying data samples because it suppress the introduced biased more than the L1-norm or not squared L2-norm minimizations. However, solving the formulated objective is very challenging because it not only non-smooth but also non-convex. As an important theoretical contribution of this work, we systematically derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the general p-th order L2-norm minimization problem, which, to the best of our knowledge, is solved for the first time in literature.

In this paper, we generalize the framework of MKL for cross-domain feature learning and propose a novel Transfer Feature Representation (TFR) algorithm. TFR learns a convex combination of multiple kernels and a linear transformation in a single optimization which integrates the minimization of distribution difference with the preservation of discriminating power across domains.  As a result, standard machine learning models trained in the source domain can be reused for the target domain data.

Oliveira","Naive Bayes (NB) is well-known to be a simple but effective classifier, especially when combined with feature selection. Unfortunately, feature selection methods are often greedy and thus cannot guarantee an optimal feature set is selected.  An alternative to feature selection is to use Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which computes a weighted average over multiple predictors; when the different predictor models correspond to different feature sets, BMA has the advantage over feature selection that its predictions tend to have lower variance on average in comparison to any single model.  In this paper, we show for the first time that it is possible to exactly evaluate BMA over the exponentially-sized powerset of NB feature models in linear-time in the number of features; this yields an algorithm about as expensive to train as a single NB model with all features, but yet provably converges to the globally optimal feature subset in the asymptotic limit of data.

We efficiently represent the distributions by using the framework of kernel embeddings of distributions that can hold high-order moment information of distributions without need for explicit density estimation.By learning latent vectors so as to maximize the posterior probability, kernels that reflect relations between words are obtained, and also words are visualized in a low-dimensional space.In experiments using 25 item review datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the GP-LVSM in prediction and visualization.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9796/9991,

Chang","Subspace recovery from noisy or even corrupted data is critical for various applications in machine learning and data analysis. To detect outliers, Robust PCA (R PCA) via Outlier Pursuit was proposed and had found many successful applications. However, the current theoretical analysis on Outlier Pursuit only shows that it succeeds when the sparsity of the corruption matrix is of O(n/r), where n is the number of the samples and r is the rank of the intrinsic matrix which may be comparable to n. Moreover, the regularization parameter is suggested as 3/(7 squareroot gamma n}, where gamma is a parameter that is not known a priori. In this paper, with incoherence condition and proposed ambiguity condition we prove that Outlier Pursuit succeeds when the rank of the intrinsic matrix is of O(n log n) and the sparsity of the corruption matrix is of O(n). We further show that the orders of both bounds are tight. Thus R-PCA via Outlier Pursuit is able to recover intrinsic matrix of higher rank and identify much denser corruptions than what the existing results could predict. Moreover, we suggest that the regularization parameter be chosen as 1 squareroot{log n}, which is definite. Our analysis waives the necessity of tuning the regularization parameter and also significantly extends the working range of the Outlier Pursuit.

Gardner, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Yixin Chen","Algorithmic reductions are one of the corner stones of theoretical computer science. Surprisingly, to-date, they have only played a limited role in machine learning. In this paper we introduce a formal and practical reduction between two of the most widely used machine learning algorithms: from the Elastic Net (and the Lasso as a special case) to the Support Vector Machine. First, we derive the reduction and summarize it in only 11 lines of MATLAB. Then, we demonstrate its high impact potential by translating recent advances in parallelizing SVM solvers directly to the Elastic Net. The resulting algorithm is a parallel solver for the Elastic Net (and Lasso) that naturally utilizes GPU and multi-core CPUs. We evaluate it on twelve real world data sets, and show that it yields identical results as the popular (and highly optimized) glmnet implementation but is up-to two orders of magnitude faster.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9856/10002,Elastic Net; SVM; Reduction; Sparsity; Parallel computation

In particular, Katz and Keyder have studied causal graphs that are hourglasses (which is a generalization of forks and inverted-forks) and shown that the corresponding cost-optimal planning problem is tractable under certain restrictions. We continue this work by studying polytrees (which is a generalization of hourglasses) under similar restrictions. We prove tractability of cost-optimal planning by providing an algorithm based on a novel notion of variable isomorphism.

He used the parameters d (domain size), k (number of paths in the DTGs) and w (treewidth of the causal graph), and showed that planning is fixed-parameter tractable (fpt) in these parameters, and fpt in only parameter k if the causal graph is a polytree. We continue this work by considering some additional cases of non-acyclic DTGs. In particular, we consider the case where each strongly connected component (SCC) in a DTG must be a simple cycle, and we show that planning is fpt for this case if the causal graph is a polytree. This is done by first preprocessing the instance to construct an equivalent abstraction and then apply Bäckströms technique to this abstraction. We use the parameters d and k, reinterpreting this as the number of paths in the condensation of a DTG, and the two new parameters c (the number of contracted cycles along a path) and pmax (an upper bound for walking around cycles, when not unbounded).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9616/9748,Planning; Parameterised Complexity; Fixed Parameter Tractability

Probabilistic temporalplanning accounts for actions whose uncertain durations can be modeled with probability density functions.

Generating diverse sets of plans is useful for task ssuch as probing user preferences and reasoning about vulnerability to cyberattacks. Generating diverse plans, and comparing different diverse planning approaches requires a domain-independent, theoretically motivated definition of the diversity distance between plans. Previously proposed diversity measures are not theoretically motivated, and can provide inconsistent results on the sameplans. We define the diversity of plans in terms of how surprising one plan is givenanother or, its inverse, the conditional information in one plan givenanother. Kolmogorov complexity provides a domain independent theory of conditional information. While Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, a related metric, Normalized Compression Distance (NCD), provides a well-behaved approximation. In this paper we introduce NCD as an alternative diversity metric, and analyze its performance empirically, in comparison with previous diversity measures, showing strengths and weaknesses of each.We also examine the use of different compressor sin NCD.

For this class of planning problems, heuristic search algorithms (including LAO*, RTDP, and related algorithms), as well as the value iteration algorithm on which they are based, lack an efficient test for convergence to an ε-optimal policy (except in the special case of discounting). We introduce a simple and efficient test for convergence that applies to SSP problems with positive action costs. The test can detect whether a policy is proper, that is, whether it achieves the goal state with probability 1. If proper, it gives error bounds that can be used to detect convergence to an ε-optimal solution. The convergence test incurs no extra overhead besides computing the Bellman residual, and the performance guarantee it provides substantially improves the utility of this class of planning algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/10048/9755,

We argue that this requirement is not necessary and demonstrate the benefit of using general cost partitioning.

The complex combinatorics of this can lead to poor scalability of leading search methods.

While partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural decision-theoretic model for this problem, the computational cost of POMDP planning grows exponentially in the number of sensors, making it feasible only for small problems. We propose a new POMDP planning method that uses greedy maximization to greatly improve scalability in the number of sensors. We show that, under certain conditions, the value function of a dynamic sensor selection POMDP is submodular and use this result to bound the error introduced by performing greedy maximization.

We show theoretically that Cedalion yields portfolios provably within a constant factor of optimal for the training set distribution. We evaluate Cedalion empirically by applying it to construct sequential planning portfolios based on component planners from the highly parameterized Fast Downward (FD) framework.

474,2015,Planning and Scheduling,Resolving Over-Constrained Probabilistic Temporal Problems through Chance Constraint Relaxation,"Peng Yu, Cheng Fang, Brian Williams","When scheduling tasks for field-deployable systems, our solutions must be robust to the uncertainty inherent in the real world. Although human intuition is trusted to balance reward and risk, humans perform poorly in risk assessment at the scale and complexity of real world problems. In this paper, we present a decision aid system that helps human operators diagnose the source of risk and manage uncertainty in temporal problems. The core of the system is a conflict-directed relaxation algorithm, called Conflict-Directed Chance-constraint Relaxation (CDCR), which specializes in resolving over-constrained temporal problems with probabilistic durations and a chance constraint bounding the risk of failure. Given a temporal problem with uncertain duration, CDCR proposes execution strategies that operate at acceptable risk levels and pinpoints the source of risk. If no such strategy can be found that meets the chance constraint, it can help humans to repair the over-constrained problem by trading off between desirability of solution and acceptable risk levels.

This problem is a very challenging combinatorial optimization problem and has attracted much academic attention. To solve it, most of the literature articles adopted heuristic approaches in which the solution is represented by a set of delivery patterns, and the search operators were derived from the traditional VRP operators. Differently, our approach employs the combination of a set of routes and a forest to represent the solution. Several forest-based operators are accordingly introduced. We integrate the new operators into a simple tabu search framework and then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by conducting experiments on existing benchmark instances.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9753/9775,split-delivery; vehicle routing; forest-based heuristic
476,2015,Planning and Scheduling,Crowdsourced Action-Model Acquisition for Planning,Hankz Hankui Zhuo,"AI planning techniques often require a given set of action models provided as input. Creating action models is, however, a difficult task that costs much manual effort. The problem of action-model acquisition has drawn a lot of interest from researchers in the past.  Despite the success of the previous systems, they are all based on the assumption that there are enough training examples for learning high-quality action models. In many real-world applications, e.g., military operation, collecting a large amount of training examples is often both difficult and costly. Instead of collecting training examples, we assume there are abundant annotators, i.e., the crowd, available to provide information learning action models. Specifically, we first build a set of soft constraints based on the labels (true or false) given by the crowd or annotators. We then builds a set of soft constraints based on the input plan traces. After that we put all the constraints together and solve them using a weighted MAX-SAT solver, and convert the solution of the solver to action models.

Unfortunately, belief state distributions in such settings are often complex and/or high dimensional, thus prohibiting the efficient application of analytical techniques for expected utility computation when real-time control is required. This leaves Monte Carlo evaluation as one of the few viable (and hence frequently used) techniques for online action selection. However, loss-insensitive Monte Carlo methods may require large numbers of samples to identify optimal actions with high certainty since they may sample from highprobability regions that do not disambiguate action utilities. In this paper we remedy this problem by deriving an optimal proposal distribution for a loss-calibrated Monte Carlo importance sampler that bounds the regret of using an estimated optimal action. Empirically, we show that using our loss-calibrated Monte Carlo method yields high-accuracy optimal action selections in a fraction of the number of samples required by conventional loss-insensitive samplers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9512/9777,

However, due to unavoidable uncertainty over models, it is difficult to obtain an exact specification of an MDP. We are interested in solving MDPs, where transition and reward functions are not exactly specified. Existing research has primarily focussed on computing infinite horizon stationary policies when optimizing robustness, regret and percentile based objectives. We focus specifically on finite horizon problems with a special emphasis on objectives that are separable over individual instantiations of model uncertainty (i.e., objectives that can be expressed as a sum over instantiations of model uncertainty): (a) First, we identify two separable objectives for uncertain MDPs: Average Value Maximization (AVM) and Confidence Probability  Maximisation (CPM). (b) Second, we provide optimization based solutions to compute policies for uncertain MDPs with such objectives. In particular, we exploit the separability of AVM and CPM objectives by employing Lagrangian dual decomposition(LDD).

Unfortunately, exact closed-form inference in the underlying Bayesian graphical models is intractable in the general case and existing approximation techniques provide few guarantees on both approximation quality and efficiency. While (Markov Chain) Monte Carlo methods provide an attractive asymptotically unbiased approximation approach, rejection sampling and Metropolis-Hastings both prove inefficient in practice, and analytical derivation of Gibbs samplers require exponential space and time in the amount of data. In this work, we show how to transform problematic piecewise likelihoods into equivalent mixture models and then provide a blocked Gibbs sampling approach for this transformed model that achieves an exponential-to-linear reduction in space and time compared to a conventional Gibbs sampler.

It has recently been applied to solving inference tasks in probabilistic logic programming, where the goal is to compute the probability of given queries being true provided a set of mutually independent random variables, a model (a logic program) and some evidence. The core of solving this inference task involves translating the logic program to a propositional theory and using a model counter. In this paper, we show that for some problems that involve inductive definitions like reachability in a graph, the translation of logic programs to SAT can be expensive for the purpose of solving inference tasks. For such problems, direct implementation of stable model semantics allows for more efficient solving. We present two implementation techniques, based on unfounded set detection, that extend a propositional model counter to a stable model counter. Our experiments show that for particular problems, our approach can outperform a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming solver by several orders of magnitude in terms of running time and space requirements, and can solve instances of significantly larger sizes on which the current solver runs out of time or memory.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9709/9780,Model Counting; Stable Model Semantics; Probabilistic Logic Programming

In particular, we consider relational models (such as Markov logic networks (MLNs)), where we cannot directly define conditional probabilities.  In relational models, there may be an unbounded number of parents in the grounding, and conditional distributions need to be defined in terms of aggregators.  The question we ask is whether and when it is possible to represent conditional probabilities at all in various relational models.  Some aggregators have been shown to be representable by MLNs, by adding auxiliary variables; however it was unknown whether they could be defined without auxiliary variables.  For other aggregators, it was not known whether they can be represented by MLNs at all.  We obtained surprisingly strong negative results on the capability of flexible undirected relational models such as MLNs to represent aggregators without affecting the original model's distribution.  We provide a map of what aspects of the models, including the use of auxiliary variables and quantifiers, result in the ability to represent various aggregators.

Little is known about efficient algorithms beyond the very special cases of linear (risk-neutral) and exponential utilities since general utilities are not separable and preclude the use of traditional dynamic programming techniques. In this paper, we consider general utility functions and investigate efficient computation of approximately optimal routing policies, where the goal is to maximize the expected utility of arriving at a destination around a given deadline.

To address this issue, this paper introduces egalitarian solution criteria for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, which are based on the maximin principle. Motivated by different application domains, we propose four maximin fairness criteria and develop corresponding algorithms for computing their optimal policies. Furthermore, we analyze the connections between these criteria and discuss and compare their characteristics.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9943/9806,Fairness; decision-making under uncertainty; solution criterion
505,2015,Reasoning under Uncertainty,An Exact Algorithm for Solving Most Relevant Explanation in Bayesian Networks,"Xiaoyuan Zhu, Changhe Yuan",Most Relevant Explanation (MRE) is a new inference task in Bayesian networks that finds the most relevant partial instantiation of target variables as an explanation for given evidence by maximizing the Generalized Bayes Factor (GBF). No exact algorithm has been developed for solving MRE previously.  This paper fills the void and introduces a breadth-first branch-and-bound MRE algorithm based on a novel upper bound on GBF. The bound is calculated by decomposing the computation of the score to a set of Markov blankets of subsets of evidence variables. Our empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm scales up exact MRE inference significantly.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9547/9807,Bayeisan Networks; Most Relevant Explanation; Generalized Bayes Factor; Exact inference

Yedidia","We address the problem of planning collision-free paths for multiple agents using optimization methods known as proximal algorithms. Recently this approach was explored in Bento et al. (2013), which demonstrated its ease of parallelization and decentralization, the speed with which the algorithms generate good quality solutions, and its ability to incorporate different proximal operators, each ensuring that paths satisfy a desired property. Unfortunately, the operators derived only apply to paths in 2D and require that any intermediate waypoints we might want agents to follow be preassigned to specific agents, limiting their range of applicability. In this paper we resolve these limitations. We introduce new operators to deal with agents moving in arbitrary dimensions that are faster to compute than their 2D predecessors and we introduce landmarks, space-time positions that are automatically assigned to the set of agents under different optimality criteria. Finally, we report the performance of the new operators in several numerical experiments.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9466/9669,Alternating direction method of multipliers; Proximal operators; Non-convex optimization; Distributed optimization; Message-passing algorithm; Semi-infinite programming; Multi-agent trajectory planning; Collision avoidance; Waypoint assignment

Kavraki, Moshe Y. Vardi","The specification of complex motion goals through temporal logics is increasingly favored in robotics to narrow the gap between task and motion planning. A major limiting factor of such logics, however, is their Boolean satisfaction condition.  To relax this limitation, we introduce a method for quantifying the satisfaction of co-safe linear temporal logic specifications, and propose a planner that uses this method to synthesize robot trajectories with the optimal satisfaction value.  The method assigns costs to violations of specifications from user-defined proposition costs.  These violation costs define a distance to satisfaction and can be computed algorithmically using a weighted automaton.  The planner utilizes this automaton and an abstraction of the robotic system to construct a product graph that captures all possible robot trajectories and their distances to satisfaction.  Then, a plan with the minimum distance to satisfaction is generated by employing this graph as the high-level planner in a synergistic planning framework.

Recent advances in depth camera technology have significantly improved human motion tracking. However, the inherent high dimensionality of interacting with the physical world makes efficiently forecasting human intention and future behavior a challenging task.  Predictive methods that estimate uncertainty are therefore critical for supporting appropriate robotic responses to the many ambiguities posed within the human-robot interaction setting. We address these two challenges, high dimensionality and uncertainty, by employing predictive inverse optimal control methods to estimate a probabilistic model of human motion trajectories. Our inverse optimal control formulation estimates quadratic cost functions that best rationalize observed trajectories framed as solutions to linear-quadratic regularization problems. The formulation calibrates its uncertainty from observed motion trajectories, and is efficient in high-dimensional state spaces with linear dynamics. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a task of anticipating the future trajectories, target locations and activity intentions of hand motions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9897/9671,Activity prediction; Target Prediction; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Linear Quadratic Regulation; Human-Robot Interaction; Depth Camera Reasoning

Evaluating thetruth or falsity of a QBF is an important task, and constructing the corresponding model or countermodel can be as important and sometimes even more useful in practice. Modern search and learning based QBF solvers rely fundamentally on resolution and can be instrumented to produce resolution proofs, from which in turn Skolem-function models and Herbrand-function countermodels can be extracted. These (counter)models are the key enabler of various applications. Not until recently the superiority of long-distanceresolution (LQ-resolution) to short-distance resolution(Q-resolution) was demonstrated. While a polynomial algorithm exists for (counter)model extraction from Q-resolution proofs, it remains open whether it exists forLQ-resolution proofs.

In this paper, we define the concept of a Boolean monotonic theory and show how to easily build efficient SMT solvers, including effective theory propagation and clause learning, for such theories. We present examples showing useful constraints that are monotonic, including many graph properties (e.g., shortest paths), and geometric properties (e.g., convex hulls). These constraints arise in problems that are otherwise difficult for SAT solvers to handle, such as procedural content generation.

The complexity of constraint satisfaction for various forms of constraints has been widely-studied, both to inform the choice of appropriate algorithms, and to understand better the boundary between polynomial-time complexity and NP-hardness. In constraint programming it is well-known that any constraint satisfaction problem can be converted to an equivalent binary problem using the so-called dual encoding. Using this standard approach any fixed collection of constraints, of arbitrary arity, can be converted to an equivalent set of constraints of arity at most two. Here we show that this transformation, although it changes the domain of the constraints, preserves all the relevant algebraic properties that determine the complexity. Moreover, we show that the dual encoding preserves many of the key algorithmic properties of the original instance. We also show that this remains true for more general valued constraint languages, where constraints may assign different cost values to different assignments. Hence, we obtain a simple proof of the fact that to classify the computational complexity of all valued constraint languages it suffices to classify only binary valued constraint languages.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9328/9699,

The Incremental Coding Length (ICL) of a feature is a measure of its entropy gain. Given a dictionary, the ICL computation does not involve any parameter, is computationally efficient and has been used for saliency detection in images with impressive results. In this paper, the rarity of a dictionary feature is learned online as its average energy, a function of its ICL. The proposed approach is applicable to real world streaming videos.

Our approach  recasts  skeleton-based shape representation as a mixture estimation problem, allowing us to apply probabilistic estimation techniques to the problem of 3D shape decomposition, extending earlier work on the 2D case. The estimated 3D shape decompositions approximate human shape decomposition judgments. We present a tractable implementation  of  the framework, which begins by over-segmenting objects at concavities, and then probabilistically merges them to create a distribution over possible decompositions.

Most existing works focused on the design of more discriminative feature representation, and have achieved promising results when the positive samples are enough. However, very limited efforts were spent on recognizing a novel action without any positive exemplars, which is often the case in the real settings due to the large amount of action classes and the users' queries dramatic variations. To address this issue, we propose to perform action recognition when no positive exemplars of that class are provided, which is often known as the zero-shot learning. Different from other zero-shot learning approaches, which exploit attributes as the intermediate layer for the knowledge transfer, our main contribution is SIR, which directly leverages the semantic inter-class relationships between the known and unknown actions followed by label transfer learning. The inter-class semantic relationships are automatically measured by continuous word vectors, which learned by the skip-gram model using the large-scale text corpus.

In this work, we study how to build effective representations for sketch recognition. First, to capture saliency patterns of different scales and spatial arrangements, a Gabor-based low-level representation is proposed. Then, based on this representation, to discovery more complex patterns in a sketch, a Hybrid Multilayer Sparse Coding (HMSC) model is proposed to learn mid-level representations. An improved dictionary learning algorithm is also leveraged in HMSC to reduce overfitting to common but trivial patterns.

Luckily, a simplified neural network module (SNNM) has been proposed to directly learn the discriminative dictionaries for avoiding the expensive inference. But the SNNM module ignores the sparse representations. Therefore, we propose a sparse SNNM module by adding the mixed-norm regularization (l1/l2 norm). The sparse SNNM modules are further stacked to build a sparse deep stacking network (S-DSN). In the experiments, we evaluate S-DSN with four databases, including Extended YaleB, AR, 15 scene and Caltech101.

This paperproposes a principled multi-task learning approachbased on Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent VariableModel (DGPLVM), named GaussianFace, for faceverification. In contrast to relying unrealistically on asingle training data source, our model exploits additional data from multiple source-domains to improve the generalization performance of face verification inan unknown target-domain. Importantly, our model can adapt automatically to complex data distributions, and therefore can well capture complex face variations inherent in multiple sources. To enhance discriminative power, we introduced a more efficient equivalent form of Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis to DGPLVM.To speed up the process of inference and prediction, we exploited the low rank approximation method. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in learning from diverse data sources and generalizing to unseen domains. Specifically, the accuracy of our algorithm achieved an impressive accuracyrate of 98.52% on the well-known and challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark.

Under the framework of spectral clustering, recent works using sparse representation, low rank representation and their extensions achieve robust clustering results by formulating the errors (e.g., corruptions) into their objective functions so that the errors can be removed from the inputs. However, these approaches have suffered from the limitation that the structure of the errors should be known as the prior knowledge. In this paper, we present a new method of robust subspace clustering by eliminating the effect of the errors from the projection space (representation) rather than from the input space. We firstly prove that ell_1-, ell_2-, and ell_infty-norm-based linear projection spaces share the property of intra-subspace projection dominance, i.e., the coefficients over intra-subspace data points are larger than those over inter-subspace data points. Based on this property, we propose a robust and efficient subspace clustering algorithm, called Thresholding Ridge Regression (TRR). TRR calculates the ell2-norm-based coefficients of a given data set and performs a hard thresholding operator; and then the coefficients are used to build a similarity graph for clustering.

Directly applying pairwise registration often leads to matching discrepancy as the mapping between two point sets can be determined either by direct correspondences or by any intermediate point set. Also, the local two-view registration tends to be sensitive to noises. We propose a novel multi-view registration method, where the optimal registration is achieved via an efficient and effective alternating concave minimization process. We further extend our solution to a general case in practice of registration among point sets with different cardinalities. Extensive empirical evaluations of peer methods on both synthetic data and real images suggest our method is robust to large disturbance. In particular, it is shown that our method outperforms peer point matching methods and performs competitively against graph matching approaches.

533,2015,Vision,Learning to Describe Video with Weak Supervision by Exploiting Negative Sentential Information,"Haonan Yu, Jeffrey Mark Siskind","Most previous work on video description trains individualparts of speech independently. It is more appealing from a linguistic point of view, for word models for all parts of speech to be learned simultaneously from whole sentences, a hypothesis suggested by some linguists for child language acquisition. In this paper, we learn to describe video by discriminatively training positive sentential labels against negative ones in a weakly supervised fashion: the meaning representations (i.e., HMMs) of individual words in these labels are learned from whole sentences without any correspondence annotation of what those words denote in the video. Textual descriptions are then generated for new video using trained word models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9481/9822,language acquisition; Hidden Markov Model; video description
534,2015,Vision,Metric Learning Driven Multi-Task Structured Output Optimization for Robust Keypoint Tracking,"Liming Zhao, Xi Li, Jun Xiao, Fei Wu, Yueting Zhuang","As an important and challenging problem in computer vision and graphics, keypoint-based object tracking is typically formulated in a spatio-temporal statistical learning framework. However, most existing keypoint trackers are incapable of effectively modeling and balancing the following three aspects in a simultaneous manner:  temporal model coherence across frames, spatial model consistency within frames, and discriminative feature construction. To address this issue, we propose a robust keypoint tracker based on spatio-temporal multi-task structured output optimization driven by discriminative metric learning. Consequently, temporal model coherence is characterized by multi-task structured keypoint model learning over several adjacent frames, while spatial model consistency is modeled by solving a geometric verification based structured learning problem. Discriminative feature construction is enabled by metric learning to ensure the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the above three modules are simultaneously optimized in a joint learning scheme. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our tracker.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9355/9823,computer vision; object tracking; metric learning; multi-task learning; structured output learning

However, conventional hallucination methods are often designed for controlled settings and cannot handle varying conditions of pose, resolution degree, and blur. In this paper, we present a new method of face hallucination, which can consistently improve the resolution of face images even with large appearance variations. Our method is based on a novel network architecture called Bi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (Bi-channel CNN). It extracts robust face representations from raw input by using deep convolutional network, then adaptively integrates two channels of information (the raw input image and face representations) to predict the high-resolution image.

536,2015,Vision,A Boosted Multi-Task Model for Pedestrian Detection with Occlusion Handling,"Chao Zhu, Yuxin Peng","Pedestrian detection is a challenging problem in computer vision. Especially, a major bottleneck for current state-of-the-art methods is the significant performance decline with increasing occlusion. A common technique for occlusion handling is to train a set of occlusion-specific detectors and merge their results directly. These detectors are trained independently and the relationship among them is ignored. In this paper, we consider pedestrian detection in different occlusion levels as different but related problems, and propose a multi-task model to jointly consider their relatedness and differences. The proposed model adopts multi-task learning algorithm to map pedestrians in different occlusion levels to a common space, where all models corresponding to different occlusion levels are constrained to share a common set of features, and a boosted detector is then constructed to distinguish pedestrians from background. The proposed approach is evaluated on the challenging Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark, and achieves state-of-the-art results on different occlusion-specific test sets.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9879/9825,Pedestrian detection; Occlusion handling; Multi-task learning

538,2015,Deployed Applications,Robust System for Identifying Procurement Fraud,"Amit Dhurandhar, Rajesh Ravi, Bruce Graves, Gopikrishnan Maniachari, Markus Ettl","An accredited biennial 2012 study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners claims that on average 5% of a company's revenue is lost because of unchecked fraud every year. The reason for such heavy losses are that it takes around 18 months for a fraud to be caught and audits catch only 3% of the actual fraud. This begs the need for better tools and processes to be able to quickly and cheaply identify potential malefactors. In this paper, we describe a robust tool to identify procurement related fraud/risk, though the general design and the analytical components could be adapted to detecting fraud in other domains. Besides analyzing standard transactional data, our solution analyzes multiple public and private data sources leading to wider coverage of fraud types than what generally exists in the marketplace. Moreover, our approach is more principled in the sense that the learning component, which is based on investigation feedback has formal guarantees. Though such a tool is ever evolving, an initial deployment of this tool over the past 6 months has found many interesting cases from compliance risk and fraud point of view, increasing the number of true positives found by over 80% compared with other state-of-the-art tools that the domain experts were previously using.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI15/paper/viewFile/9271/9886,collusion; risk; Big Data

The study of civil unrest is a key topic for political scientists as it helps capture an important mechanism by which citizenry express themselves. In countries where civil unrest is lawful, qualitative analysis has revealed that more than 75% of the protests are planned, organized, and/or announced in advance; therefore detecting future time mentions in relevant news and social media is a direct way to develop a protest forecasting system. We develop such a system in this paper, using a combination of key phrase learning to identify what to look for, probabilistic soft logic to reason about location occurrences in extracted results, and time normalization to resolve future tense mentions. We illustrate the application of our system to 10 countries in Latin America, viz. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

A patient’s medical problem list is by far the most critical information that a physician uses in treatment and care of a patient. In spite of its critical role, its curation, manual or automated, has been an unmet need in clinical practice.  We developed a machine learning technique in IBM Watson to automatically generate a patient’s medical problem list. The machine learning model uses lexical and medical features extracted from a patient’s record using NLP techniques. We show that the automated method achieves 70% recall and 67% precision based on the gold standard that medical experts created on a set of de-identified patient records from a major hospital system in the US.

Machine learning models, including random forests, gradient boosting trees, and linear regression, are used to predict the expected hail size from each forecast storm. The individual hail size forecasts are merged with a spatial neighborhood ensemble probability technique to produce a consensus probability of hail at least 25.4 mm in diameter. The system was evaluated during the 2014 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hazardous Weather Testbed Experimental Forecast Program and compared with a physics-based hail size model.

GUIDE has the ability to induce a cost function starting with a set of historical tracks used as training input, with no requirement that these tracks be even close to cost-optimal. Given a cost function, either induced as above or provided from elsewhere, GUIDE can then compare planned routes with the actual tracks executed to adjust that cost function as either the environment or human preferences change over time.

Shell","This paper describes an end-to-end learning framework that allows a novice to create a model from data easily by helping structure the model building process and capturing extended aspects of domain knowledge. By treating the whole modeling process interactively and exploiting high-level knowledge in the form of an ontology, the framework is able to aid the user in a number of ways, including in helping to avoid pitfalls such as data dredging. Prudence must be exercised to avoid these hazards: certain conclusions may be supported by extra knowledge if, for example, there are reasons to trust a particular narrower set of hypotheses. This paper adopts the solution of using higher-level knowledge in order to allow this sort of domain knowledge to be inferred automatically, thereby selecting only relevant input attributes and thence constraining the hypothesis space. We describe how the framework automatically exploits structured knowledge in an ontology to identify relevant concepts, and how a data extraction component can make use of online data sources to find measurements of those concepts so that their relevance can be evaluated. To validate our approach, models of four different problem domains were built using our implementation of the framework.

In many modern Internet applications, like sponsored search and crowdsourcing, the two basic assumptions are violated and new challenges are posed to both machine learning and game theory. To better model and study such applications, we need to go beyond conventional machine learning and game theory (mechanism design), and adopt a new approach called mechanism learning with mechanism induced data. Specifically, we propose to learn a behavior model from data to describe how real agents play the complicated game, instead of making the full-rationality assumption. Then we propose to optimize the mechanism by using the learned behavior models to predict the future behaviors of agents in response to the new mechanism. Because the above process couples mechanism learning and behavior learning in a loop, new algorithms and theories are needed to perform the task and guarantee the asymptotical performance. As shown in this paper, there are many interesting research topics along this direction, many of which are still open problems, waiting for researchers in our community to deeply investigate.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9621/9676,

A sequential contingency plan for steering evolution is constructed computationally for the setting at hand. In the biological context, the opponent (e.g., a disease) has a systematic handicap because it evolves myopically.

Third, the strategy from the abstract game is mapped back to the original game. In this paper, I will review key developments in the field. I present reasons for abstracting games, and point out the issue of abstraction pathology. I then review the practical algorithms for information abstraction and action abstraction. I then cover recent theoretical breakthroughs that beget bounds on the quality of the strategy from the abstract game, when measured in the original game.

In order to meet usability requirements set by users, efforts have been made to equip OBDA  system with explanation facilities. One important explanation tool for DL ontologies, referred to as query abduction, can be formalised as abductive reasoning. In particular, given an ontology and an observation (i.e., a query with an answer), an explanation to the observation is a set of facts that together with the ontology can entail the observation. In this paper, we develop a sound and complete algorithm of query abduction for general conjunctive queries in ELH ontologies. This is achieved through ontology approximation and query rewriting. We implemented a prototypical system using the highly optimized Prolog engine XSB.

To ensure that our system is robust to word variants that can arise from different forms of a root word, we generate multiple variant hypothesis for each word based on the sequence labeler's prediction.

However, due to the lack of long-term real tracking daily data in individual level, most current works focus their efforts on population level and short-term small group. An ignored yet important task is to find the sentiment spreading mechanism in individual level from their daily behavior data. This paper studies this task by raising the following fundamental and summarization question, being not sufficiently answered by the literature so far:Given a social network, how the sentiment spread? The current individual-level network spreading models always assume one can infect others only when he/she has been infected. Considering the negative emotion spreading characters in individual level, we loose this assumption, and give an individual negative emotion spreading model.

Word embedding is to represent words in a continuous and multidimensional vector space, so that it is easy to calculate the semantic similarity between words by calculating the vector distance. We evaluate the models on MSH Dataset and ScienceWISE Dataset, and both models outperform the state-of-art methods on accuracy. The experimental results show that word embedding helps to improve acronym disambiguation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9404/9721,Word Embedding; Acronym Disambiguation; Machine Learing

However, many viruses, including HIV, can rapidly escape the therapeautic effect through a sequence of mutations. We propose to design vaccines, or, equivalently, antibody sequences that make such evasion difficult. We frame this as a bilevel combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the escape cost, defined as the minimum number of virus mutations to evade binding an antibody. Binding strength can be evaluated by a protein modeling software, Rosetta, that serves as an oracle and computes a binding score for an input virus-antibody pair. However, score calculation for each possible such pair is intractable. %, as the search space is of the order 10^{130}. We propose a three-pronged approach to address this: first, application of local search, using a native antibody sequence as leverage, second, machine learning to predict binding for antibody-virus pairs, and third, a poisson regression to predict escape costs as a function of antibody sequence assignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and exhibit an antibody with a far higher escape cost (7) than the native (1).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9306/9726,"Heuristic search, Machine learning, Optimization"

In this work, we present GEF (“Grammatical Evolution for the Finch”), a system that employs grammatical evolution to create a Finch robot controller program in Java.  The system uses both the traditional GE model as well as employing extensions and augmentations that push the boundaries of goal-oriented contexts in which robots typically act including a meta-level handler that fosters a level of self-awareness in the robot. To handle contingencies, the GEF system has been endowed with the ability to perform meta-level jumps. When confronted with unplanned events and dynamic changes in the environment, our robot will automatically transition to pursue another goal, changing fitness functions, and generate and invoke operating system level scripting to facilitate the change.  The robot houses a raspberry pi controller that is capable of executing one (evolved) program while wirelessly receiving another over an asynchronous client.

Secondly, we apply a probabilistic model to map the meaning representation, including those aggregation functions, to a structured query.The experimental results showed that our method can better understand aggregation questions, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on the Free917 dataset while still maintaining promising performance on a more challenging dataset, WebQuestions, without extra training.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9790/9743,

625,2015,Doctoral Consortium,Exploiting the Structure of Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems,Ferdinando Fioretto,"In the proposed thesis, we study Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs), which are problems where several agents coordinate with each other to optimize a global cost function. The use of DCOPs has gained momentum, due to their capability of addressing complex and naturally distributed problems. A majority of the work in DCOP addresses the resolution problem by detaching the model from the resolution process, where they assume that each agent controls exclusively one variable of the problem (Burke et al. 2006). This assumption often is not reflected in the model specifications, and may lead to inefficient communication requirements. Another limitation of current DCOP resolution methods is their inability to capitalize on the presence of structural information, which may allow incoherent/unnecessary data to reticulate among the agents (Yokoo 2001). The purpose of the proposed dissertation is to study how to adapt and integrate insights gained from centralized solving techniques in order to enhance DCOP performance and scalability, enabling their use for the resolution of real-world complex problems. To do so, we hypothesize that one can exploit the DCOP structure in both problem modeling and problem resolution phases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9293/9827,DCOP; CP; Smart Grids

Specifically, we improve on the effectiveness of energy-aware room-booking and occupancy scheduling approaches, by allowing the scheduling decisions to rely on an explicit model of the building's occupancy-based HVAC control. From computational standpoint, this is a challenging topic as HVAC models are inherently non-linear non-convex, and occupancy scheduling models additionally introduce discrete variables capturing the time slot and location at which each activity is scheduled.

In recent years, ASP has been frequently applied for the computation of reasoning problems represented in argumentation-theoretical-terms and has been found an efficient method for determining solutions to problems in Argumentation Theory.

637,2015,Doctoral Consortium,Multi-Agent Team Formation: Solving Complex Problems by Aggregating Opinions,Leandro Soriano Marcolino,"It is known that we can aggregate the opinions of different agents to find high-quality solutions to complex problems. However, choosing agents to form a team is still a great challenge. Moreover, it is essential to use a good aggregation methodology in order to unleash the potential of a given team in solving complex problems. In my thesis, I present two different novel models to aid in the team formation process. Moreover, I propose a new methodology for extracting rankings from existing agents.

However, inference in these rich, relational representations is quite challenging. The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in MLN inference, enabling it to solve much harder and more complex tasks than is possible today. To this end, I will develop techniques that exploit logical structures and symmetries that are either explicitly or implicitly encoded in the MLN representation and demonstrate their usefulness by using them to solve hard real-world problems in the field of natural language understanding.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9333/9840,

Based on planning technology, we are able to provide advanced user assistance for operating technical devices. We present a system that assists a human user in setting up a complex home theater consisting of several HiFi devices. For a human user, the task is rather challenging due to a large number of different ports of the devices and the variety of available cables. The system supports the user by giving detailed instructions how to assemble the theater.

A popular strategy for general query spelling correction is to generate corrections from query logs. However, this strategy is not effective in Email Search for two reasons: 1) query log of any sin- gle user is typically not rich enough to provide potential corrections for a new query 2) corrections generated us- ing query logs of other users are not particularly useful since the mail data as well as search intent are highly specific to the user. We address the challenge of design- ing an effective spelling correction algorithm for Email Search in the absence of query logs. We propose SpEQ, a Machine Learning based approach that generates cor- rections for misspelled queries directly from the user’s own mail data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9767/9843,"email, search, spelling correction, statistical ranking, machine learning, learning to rank"

The process usually starts with data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation (e.g. outlier removal, missing value imputation), then proceeds to model building, and finally a presentation of predictions that align with the end-users objectives and preferences. It is a long, complex, and sometimes artful process requiring substantial time and effort, especially because of the combinatorial explosion in choices of algorithms (and platforms), their parameters, and their compositions. Tools that can help automate steps in this process have the potential to accelerate the time-to-delivery of useful results, expand the reach of data science to non-experts, and offer a more systematic exploration of the available options.

We introduce a distributed version of the most commonly used equilibrium-finding algorithm, counterfactual regret minimization (CFR), which enables CFR to scale to dramatically larger abstractions and numbers of cores. The new algorithm begets constraints on the abstraction so as to make the pieces running on different computers disjoint. We introduce an algorithm for generating such abstractions while capitalizing on state-of-the-art abstraction ideas such as imperfect recall and the earth-mover's-distance similarity metric. Our techniques enabled an equilibrium computation of unprecedented size on a supercomputer with a high inter-blade memory latency. Prior approaches run slowly on this architecture. Our approach also leads to a significant improvement over using the prior best approach on a large shared-memory server with low memory latency. Finally, we introduce a family of post-processing techniques that outperform prior ones. We applied these techniques to generate an agent for two-player no-limit Texas Hold'em.

As a result, it becomes feasible to automate the processing of such problems, but accuracy is not very high due to the conceptual difficulty of these problems. In this paper, we integrated crowdsourcing with MapReduce to provide a scalable innovative human-machine solution to AI-hard problems, which is called CrowdMR. In CrowdMR, the majority of problem instances are automatically processed by machine while the troublesome instances are redirected to human via crowdsourcing.

Given little information on the live TV programs, our proposed VecLP system can effectively collect necessary information on both the programs and the subscribers as well as a large volume of related online videos, and then recommend the relevant Internet videos to the subscribers. For that, the key frames are firstly detected from the live TV programs, and then visual and textual features are extracted from these frames to enhance the understanding of the TV broadcasts. Furthermore, by utilizing the subscribers' profiles and their social relationships, a user preference model is constructed, which greatly improves the diversity of the recommendations in our system. The subscriber's browsing history is also recorded and used to make a further personalized recommendation. This work also illustrates how our proposed VecLP system makes it happen.

Alar is useful in quality assurance of knowledge bases (finding false, vague, or misleading statements; or missing assertions).

650,2015,Demonstrations,Visualization Techniques for Topic Model Checking,"Jaimie Murdock, Colin Allen","Topic models remain a black box both for modelers and for end users in many respects. From the modelers' perspective, many decisions must be made which lack clear rationales and whose interactions are unclear — for example, how many topics the algorithms should find (K), which words to ignore (aka the ""stop list""), and whether it is adequate to run the modeling process once or multiple times, producing different results due to the algorithms that approximate the Bayesian priors.  Furthermore, the results of different parameter settings are hard to analyze, summarize, and visualize, making model comparison difficult. From the end users' perspective, it is hard to understand why the models perform as they do, and information-theoretic similarity measures do not fully align with humanistic interpretation of the topics. We present the Topic Explorer, which advances the state-of-the-art in topic model visualization for document-document and topic-document relations. It brings topic models to life in a way that fosters deep understanding of both corpus and models, allowing users to generate interpretive hypotheses and to suggest further experiments.

First, our method generates the objectness map via object proposals. Based on the objectness map, we estimate the background margin and compute the corresponding foreground map which prefers the foreground objects. From the objectness map and the foreground map, the compactness map is formed to favor the compact objects.

While crowdsourcing is motivated by the promise of leveraging people's intelligence and diverse skillsets in computational processes, the human aspects of this workforce are all too often overlooked. Instead, workers are frequently viewed as interchangeable components that can be statistically managed to eek out reasonable outputs.We are quickly moving past and rejecting these notions, and beginning to understand that it is sometimes the very abstractions that we introduce to make human computation feasible, e.g., abstracting humans behind APIs or isolating workers from others in order to ensure independent input, that can lead to the problems that we then set about trying to solve, e.g., poor or inconsistent quality work. Creating a brighter future for crowd work will require new socio-technical systems that not only decompose tasks, recruit and coordinate workers, and make sense of results, but also find interesting tasks for people to contribute to, structure tasks so that workers learn from them as they go, and eventually automate mundane parts of work.
