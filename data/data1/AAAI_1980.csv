0,1980,Early Vision Processing,A Statistical Technique for Recovering Surface Orientation from Texture in Natural Imagery,Andrew P. Witkin,"A statistical method is reported for inferring the shape and orientation of irregularly marked surfaces using image geometry. The basis for solving this problem lies in an understanding of projective geometry, coupled with simple statistical models of the contour generating process. This approach is first applied to the special case of surfaces known to be planar. The distortion of contour shape imposed by projection is treated as a signal to be estimated, and variations of non-projective origin are treated as noise. The resulting method is next extended to the estimation of curved surfaces, and applied successfully to natural images. The statistical estimation strategy is then experimentally compared to human perception of orientation: human observers’ judgements of tilt correspond closely to the estimates produced by the planar strategy.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-001.pdf,
1,1980,Early Vision Processing,"Mapping Image Properties into Shape Constraints: Skewed Symmetry and Affine-Transformable Patterns, and the Shape-from-Texture Paradigm","John R. Kender, Takeo Kanade","Certain image properties, such as parallelisms, symmetries, and repeated patterns, provide cues for perceiving the 3-D shape from a 2-D picture. This paper demonstrates how we can map those image properties into 3-D shape constraints by associating appropriate assumptions with them and by using appropriate computational and representational tools. We begin with the exploration of how one specific image property, ""skewed symmetry"", can be defined and formulated to serve as a cue to the determination of surface orientations. Then we will discuss the issue from two new, broader viewpoints. One is the class of Affine-transformable patterns. It has various interesting properties, and includes skewed symmetry as a special case. The other is the computational paradigm of shape-from-texture. Skewed symmetry is derived in a second, independent way, as an instance of the application of the paradigm. This paper further claims that the ideas and techniques presented here are applicable to many other properties, under the general framework of the shape-from-texture paradigm, with the underlying meta-heuristic of non-accidental image properties.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-002.pdf,
2,1980,Early Vision Processing,What Should be Computed In Low Level Vision Systems,"William B. Thompson, Albert Yonas","Recently, there has been a trend towards developing low level vision models based on an analysis of the mapping of a three dimensional scene into a two dimensional image. Emphasis has been placed on recovering precise metric spatial information about the scene. While we agree with this approach, we suggest that more attention be paid to what should be computed. Pschophysical scaling, adaptation, and direct determination of higher order relations may be as useful in the perception of spatial layout as in other perceptual domains. When applied to computer vision systems, such processes may reduce dependance on overly specific scene constraints.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-003.pdf,
3,1980,Early Vision Processing,Interpreting Line Drawings as Three-Dimensional Surfaces,"Harry G. Barrow, Jay M. Tenenbaum","We propose a computational model for interpreting line drawings as three-dimensional surfaces, based on constraints on local surface orientation along extremal and discontinuity boundaries. Specific techniques are described for two key processes: recovering the three-dimensional conformation of a space curve (e.g., a surface boundary) from its two-dimensional projection in an image, and interpolating smooth surfaces from orientation constraints aiong extremal boundaries.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-004.pdf,
4,1980,Early Vision Processing,Shape Encoding and Subjective Contours,"Mike Brady, W. E. L. Grimson, D. J. Langridge","Ullman has investigated the shape of subjective contours. In fact, the work is more generally applicable to other cases of perceptual shape completion, in which the visual system is not constrained by actual physical intensity changes. Examples include patterns formed from dots, line drawings and alphabetical characters.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-005.pdf,
5,1980,Scene Analysis,Information Needed to Label a Scene,Eugene C. Freuder,I analyze the information content of scene labels and provide a measure for the complexity of line drawings. The Huffman-Clowes label set is found to contain surprisingly little additional information as compared to more basic label sets. The complexity of a line drawing is measured in terms of the amount of local labeling required to determine global labeling. A bound is obtained on the number of lines which must be labeled before a full labeling of a line drawing is uniquely determined. I present an algorithm which combines local sensory probing with knowledge of labeling constraints to proceed directly to a labeling analysis of a given scene.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-006.pdf,
6,1980,Scene Analysis,Interpretive Vision and Restrictive Graphs,"Rodney A. Brooks, Thomas O. Binford","We describe an approach to image interpretation which uses a dynamically determined interaction of prediction and observation. We provide a representational mechanism, built on our geometric modeling scheme which facilitates the computational processes necessary for image interpretation. The mechanism implements generic object classes and specializations of models, enables case analysis in reasoning about incompletely specified situations, and manages multiple hypothesized instantiations of modeled objects in a single image. It is based on restriction nodes and quantified variables. A natural partial order on restriction nodes can be defined by comparing the satisifiability of their constraints. Nodes are arranged in an incomplete restriction graph whose arcs represent relations of nodes under the partial order. Predictions are matched to descriptions by finding maximal isomorphic subgraphs of a prediction graph and an observation graph [see paper] subject to a naturally associated infimum of restriction nodes being satisifiable. In this manner constraints implied by local two dimensional matches of image features to predicted features are propagated back to the three dimensional model enforcing global consistency.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-007.pdf,

8,1980,Motion Analysis,Constraint-Based Inference from Image Motion,Daryl T. Lawton,"We deal with the inference of environmental information (position and velocity) from a sequence of images formed during relative motion of an observer and the environment. A simple method is used to transform relations between environmental points into equations expressed in terms of constants determined from the images and unknown depth values. This is used to develop equations for environmental inference from several cases of rigid body motion, some having direct solutions. Also considered are the problems of non-unique solutions and the necessity of decomposing the inferred motion into natural components.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-009.pdf,
9,1980,Motion Analysis,Static Analysis of Moving Jointed Objects,Jon A. Webb,"The problem of interpreting images of moving jointed objects is considered.

10,1980,Motion Analysis,Bootstrap Stereo,Marsha J. Hannah,"Lockheed has been working on techniques for navigation of an autonomous aerial vehicle using passively sensed images. One technique which shows promise is bootstrap stereo, in which the vehicle’s position is determined from the perceived locations of known ground control points, then two known vehicle camera positions are used to locate corresponding image points on the ground, creating new control points. This paper describes the components of bootstrap stereo.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-011.pdf,
11,1980,Robotic Vision,Locating Partially Visible Objects: The Local Feature Focus Method,Robert C. Bolles,"A new method of locating partially visible two-dimensional objects has been designed. The method is applicable to complex industrial parts that may contain several occurrences of local features such as holes and corners. The matching process is robust, because it basis the decisions on groups of mutually consistent features, and it is relatively fast, because it concentrates on key features that are automatically selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of CAD type of models of the objects.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-012.pdf,
12,1980,Robotic Vision,Interference Detection and Collision Avoidance Among Three Dimensional Objects,"N. Ahuja, R. T. Chien, R. Yen, N. Bridwell",Two methods for detecting intersections among three dimensional objects are described. The first method involves detecting overlap among the projections of the objects on a given set of planes. The second method uses a three dimensional octree representation of the objects. Intersections are detected by traversing the trees for the obstacles and the moving objects. Application of the methods to collision avoidance is discussed.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-013.pdf,
13,1980,Robotic Vision,Automated Inspection Using Gray-Scale Statistics,Stephen T. Barnard,"A method for using gray-scale statistics for the inspection of assemblies is described. A test image of an assembly under inspection is registered with a model image of a nondefective assembly and the two images are compared on the basis of two statistical tests: a X^2 test of the two marginal gray-level distributions and the correlation coefficient of the joint distribution. These tests are made in local subareas that correspond to important structure, such as parts and subassemblies. The subareas are compiled in an off-line training phase. The X^2 measure is most sensitive to missing or damaged parts, whereas the correlation coefficient is most sensitive to mispositioned parts. It is also possible to detect overall lighting changes and misregistration with these measures. Two examples are presented that show how the tests detect two types of defects.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-014.pdf,

16,1980,Program Synthesis,Question Ordering In a Mixed Initiative Program Specification Dialogue,Louis Steinberg,"It would be nice if a computer system could accept a program specification in the form of a mixed initiative dialogue. One capability such a system must have is the ability to ask questions in a coherent order. We will see a number of reasons it is better if such a system produces all the questions it can and has a ""dialogue moderator"" choose which to ask next, than if the system asks the first question it thinks of. DM, the dialogue moderator of PSI, chooses questions by searching a network model of a program, under control of a set of heuristic rules. This technique is simple and flexible.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-017.pdf,
17,1980,Program Synthesis,Some Algorithm Design Methods,Steve Tappel,"Algorithm design may be defined as the task of finding an efficient data and control structure that implements a given input-output specification. This paper describes a methodology for control structure design, applicable to combinatorial algorithms involving search or minimization. The methodology includes an abstract process representation based on generators, constraints, mappings and orderings, and a set of plans and transformations by which to obtain an efficient algorithm. As an example, the derivation of a shortest-path algorithm is shown. The methods have been developed with automatic programming systems in mind, but should also be useful to human programmers.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-018.pdf,
18,1980,Program Synthesis,Automatic Goal-Directed Program Transformation,Stephen Fickas,"This paper focuses on a major problem faced by the user of a semi-automatic, transformation-based program-development system: management of low level details. I will argue that it is feasible to take some of this burden off of the user by automating portions of the development sequence. A prototype system is introduced which employs knowledge of the transformation domain in achieving a given program goal state. It is assumed that such a system will run in a real environment containing a large library of both generalized low level and specialized high level transformations.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-019.pdf,
19,1980,Program Synthesis,"Incremental, Informal Program Acquisition",Brian P. McCune,"Program acquisition is the transformation of a program specification into an executable, but not necessarily efficient, program that meets the given specification. This paper presents a solution to one aspect of the program acquisition problem, the incremental construction of program models from informal descriptions, in the form of a framework that includes (1) a formal language for expressing program fragments that contain informalities, (2) a control structure for the incremental recognition and assimilation of such fragments, and (3) a knowledge base of rules for acquiring programs specified with informalities.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-020.pdf,
20,1980,Program Synthesis,A Basis for a Theory of Program Synthesis,P. A. Subrahmanyam,"In order to obtain a quantum jump in the quality and reliability of software, it is imperative to have a coherent theory of program synthesis which can serve as the basis for a sophisticated (interactive) software development tool. We argue that viewing the problem of (automatic) program synthesis as that (automatically) synthesizing implementations of abstract data types provides a viable basis for a general theory of program synthesis.

21,1980,Program Synthesis,A Program Model and Knowledge Base for Computer Aided Program Synthesis,Richard J. Wood,"Program synthesis is a complex task comprising many interacting subactivities and requiring access to a variety of knowledge sources. Recent investigations have discovered the inadequacies of current synthesis techniques to keep pace with increasing difficulties of managing large intricate problem solutions. An alternative approach to software methodologies is the development of intelligent computer systems that manage the vast amount of information assimilated and accessed during this process. The system’s ""intelligence"" is characterized not by an innate ability to invent solutions, but by the incorporation of an internal model of the problem domain and corresponding program solution.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-022.pdf,
22,1980,Theorem Proving,An Efficient Relevance Criterion for Mechanical Theorem Proving,David A. Plaisted,"To solve problems in the presence of large knowledge bases, it is important to be able to decide which knowledge is relevant to the problem at hand. This issue is discussed in [1, see paper]. We present efficient algorithms for selecting a relevant subset of knowledge. These algorithms are presented in terms of resolution theorem proving in the first-order predicate calculus, but the concepts are sufficiently general to apply to other logics and other inference rules as well. These ideas should be particularly important when there are tens or hundreds of thousands of input clauses. We also present a complete theorem proving strategy which selects at each step the resolvents that appear most relevant. This strategy is compatible with arbitrary conventional strategies such as P-deduction, locking resolution, et cetera. Also, this strategy uses nontrivial semantic information and ""associations"" between facts in a way similar to human problem-solving processes.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-023.pdf,
23,1980,Theorem Proving,On Proving Laws of the Algebra of FP-Systems in Edinburgh LCF,Jacek Leszczylowski,"J.Backus, in CACM 21/8, defined a class of applicative programming systems called FP /functional programming/ systems in which a user has: 1.objects built recursively from atoms, UU /an undefined element/ and objects by a strict /i.e. a UU-preserving/ ""list"" operator, 2. elementary functions over objects, 3. tools for building functions out of already defined functions. One can think of a machine support while working with FP systems and proving facts about FP systems as well as facts concerning the functions being defined. The choice of EDINBURGH LCF is rather natural because it is an interactive ccmputer system /implemented in LISP/ for reasoning about functions /see [6]/. It consists of two parts. The first part is a family of calculi each of which is characterized by four factors: 1. type operators /representing domains in the sense of Scott’s theory; see [11]/, 2. constants /representing continuous functions/, 3. axioms, 4. inference rules. One of them, PPLAMBDA, is given as the ""initial"" calculus, and other calculi may be built by users as extensions of existing calculi. The second part is a high level programming language ML which is fully higher order and is strongly typed. Its polymorphic types make it as convenient as typeless languages. This paper is a short report on the application of EDINBURGH LCF to proving the laws of the algebra of FP systems listed by Backus in [1]. Actualiy, we generalized FP-systems and the laws are formulated in stronger form than it was done by Backus. We briefly describe /sec.II/ the style of proving with the system, then /sec.III/ comment the strategies used in the proofs giving only their specifications. The summing up remarks will be given in sec.IV. More detailed report on the project is given in [9].",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-024.pdf,
24,1980,Theorem Proving,A Technique for Establishing Completeness Results In Theorem Proving with Equality,Gerald E. Peterson,"This is a summary of the methods and results of a longer paper of the same name which will appear elsewhere. The main result is that an automatic theorem proving system consisting of resolution, paramodulation, factoring, equality reversal, simplification and subsumption removal is complete in first-order logic with equality. When restricted to sets of equality units, the resulting system is very much like the Knuth-Bendix procedure. The completeness of resolution and paramodulation without the functionally reflexive axioms is a corollary. The methods used are based upon the familiar ideas of reduction and semantic trees, and should be helpful in showing that other theorem proving systems with equality are complete.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-025.pdf,

Empirical results with game-playing computer programs have led to the general belief that searching deeper on a game tree improves the quality of a decision. The surprising result of the research summarized in this paper is that there is an infinite class of game trees for which increasing the search depth does not improve the decision quality, but instead makes the decision more and more random.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-030.pdf,
30,1980,Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations,Max-Min Chaining of Weighted Causal Assertions is Loop Free,"S. W. Ng, Adrian Walker","If a system uses assertions of the general form x causes y, (e.g. MYCIN rules) then loop situations in which X1 causes X2, X2 causes X3, .... , Xn causes X1, are, intuitively, best avoided. If an assertion has an attached confidence weight, as in x(0.8)-causes y , then one can choose to say that the confidence in a chain of such assertions is as strong as the weakest link in the chain. If there are several chains of assertions from X to Z, then one can choose to say that X causes Z with a confidence equal to that of the strongest chain. From these choices, it follows that the confidence that X causes Z corresponds to a loop-free chain of assertions. This is true even if there are chains from X to Z with common subchains and loops within loops. An algorithm for computing the confidence is described.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-031.pdf,

That domain-dependent expert system was, in turn, a product of a tradition of increasingly sophisticated production-rule-based expert systems. The use of production systems to encapsulate expert knowledge in manageable and relatively independent chunks has been a strong recurrent theme in Al.

33,1980,Cooperating Expert Systems,Representation of Task-Specific Knowledge in a Gracefully Interacting User Interface,"Eugene Ball, Phil Hayes","Command interfaces to current interactive systems often appear inflexible and unfriendly to casual and expert users alike. We are constructing an interface that will behave more cooperatively (by correcting spelling and grammatical errors, asking the user to resolve ambiguities in subparts of commands, etc.). Given that present-day interfaces often absorb a major portion of implementation effort, such a gracefully interacting interface can only be practical if it is independent of the specific tool or functional subsystem with which it is used. Our interface is tool-independent in the sense that all its information about a particular tool is expressed in a declarative tool description. This tool description contains schemas for each operation that the tool can perform, and for each kind of object known to the system. The operation schemas describe tne relevant parameters, their types and defaults, and the object schemas give corresponding structural descriptions in terms of defining and derived subcomponents. The schemas also include input syntax, display formats, and explanatory text. We discuss how these schemas can be used by the tool-independent interface to provide a graceful interface to the tool they describe.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-034.pdf,

37,1980,Problem Solving and Control,A Planner for Reasoning about Knowledge and Action,Douglas E. Appelt,"This paper reports recent results of research on planning systems that have the ability to deal with multiple agents and to reason about their knowledge and the actions they perform. The planner uses a knowledge representation based on the possible worlds semantics axiomatization of knowledge, belief and action advocated by Moore. This work has been motivated by the need for such capabilities in natural language processing systems that will plan speech acts and natural language utterances. The sophisticated use of natural language requires reasoning about other agents, what they might do and what they believe, and therefore provides a suitable domain for planning to achieve goals involving belief. This paper does not directly address issues of language per se, but focuses on the problem-solving rcquirements of a language-using system, and describes a working system, KAMP (Knowledge And Modalities Planner), that embodies the ideas reported herein.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-038.pdf,

This paradigm has some basic difficulties when applied to certain types of problems. Properly constructed arithmetic functions, such as those using our SNAC principles, can do such problems very well. SNAC constructions have considerable generality and robustness, and thus tend to outperform hand coded case statements as domains get larger. We show how a SNAC function can avoid getting stuck on a sub-optimal hill while hill-climbing.

From the point of view of each of these agents, the others are dynamic entities that possess information about the world, have goals, make plans to achieve these goals, and execute these plans. Thus, each agent must represent not only the usual information about objects in the world and the preconditions and effects of its own actions, but it must also represent and reason about what other agents believe and what they may do.

McKay","Recursive rules, such as ""Your parents’ ancestors are your ancestors"", although very useful for theorem proving, natural language understanding, questions-answering and information retrieval systems, present problems for many such systems, either causing infinite loops or requiring that arbitrarily many copies of them be made. We have written an inference system that can use recursive rules without either of these problems. The solution appeared automatically from a technique designed to avoid redundant work. A recursive rule causes a cycle to be built in an AND/OR graph of active processes. Each pass of data through the cycle resulting in another answer. Cycling stops as soon as either the desired answer is produced, no more answers can be produced, or resource bounds are exceeded.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-044.pdf,

45,1980,Advanced Knowledge Representation,Knowledge Embedding in the Description System Omega,"Carl Hewitt, G. Attardi, M. Simi","Omega is a description system for knowledge embedding which combines mechanisms of the predicate calculus, type systems, and pattern matching systems. It can express arbitrary predicates (achieving the power of the w-order quantificational calculus), type declarations in programming systems (Algal, Simula, etc.), pattern matching languages (Planner, Merlin, KRL, etc.). Omega gains much of its power by unifying these mechanisms in a single formalism. Omega is based on a small number of primitive concepts. It is sufficiently powerful to be able to express its own rules of inference. In this way Omega represents a self-describing system in which a great deal of knowledge about itself can be embedded. The techniques in Omega represent an important advance in the creation of self-describing systems without engendering the problems discovered by Russell. Meta-descriptions (in the sense used in mathematical logic) are ordinary descriptions in Omega. Together with Jerry Barber we have constructed a preliminary implementation of Omega on the M.I.T.

The language designer typically has one particular application domain in mind: as subsequent types of applications are tried, what had originally been useful features become undesirable limitations, and the language is overhauled or scrapped. One remedy to this bleak cycle might be to construct a representational scheme whose domain is the field of representational languages itself. Toward this end, we designed and implemented RLL, a frame-based Representation Languange Language. The components of representation languages in general (such as slots and inheritance mechanisms) and of RLL itself are encoded declaratively as frames. Modifying these frames can change the semantics of RLL, by radically altering the character of the RLL environment.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-047.pdf,

The analysis method which is chosen will depend not only on the objects in the problem and their interactions, but also on the context, the accuracy needed, the factors which are known, the factors which are desired, and the magnitudes of certain quantities.

We begin by arguing that the real work of carrying out office procedures is different in kind from the standard computer science notions of procedure ""execution"". Specifically, office work often requires planning and problem solving in particular situations to determine what is to be done. This planning is based on the goals of the tasks with which the procedures are associated and takes place in the context of an inherently open-ended body of world knowledge. We explore some of the ways in which a system can provide support for such work and discuss the requirements that the nature of the work places on such support systems. We argue that the AI research fields of planning and knowledge representation provide useful paradigms and techniques for meeting those requirements, and that the requirements, in turn, present new research problems in those fields. Finally, we advocate an approach to designing such office systems that emphasizes a symbiotic relationship between system and office worker.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-057.pdf,
57,1980,Specialized Issues in Knowledge Representation,Metaphors and Models,Michael R. Genesereth,"Much of one’s knowledge of a task domain is in the form of simple facts and procedures. While these facts and procedures may vary from domain to domain, there is often substantial similarity in the ""abstract structure"" of the knowledge. For example, the notion of a hierarchy is found in biological taxonomy, the geological classification of time, and the organization chart of a corporation. One advantage of recognizing such abstractions is that they can be used in selecting metaphors and models that are computationally very powerful and efficient. This power and efficiency can be used in evaluating plausible hypotheses about new domains and can thereby motivate the induction of abstractions even in the face of partial or inconsistent data. Furthermore, there is a seductive argument for how such information processing criteria can be used in characterizing ""intuitive"" thought and in explaining the cogency of causal arguments. The idea of large-scale, unified knowledge structures like abstractions is not a new one. The gestalt psychologists (e.g. [Kohler]) had the intuition decades ago, and recently Kuhn [Kuhn], Minsky [Minsky], and Schank [Schank & Abelson] have embodied similar intuitions in their notions of paradigms, frames, and scripts. (See also [Bobrow & Norman] and [Moore & Newell] for related ideas.) The novelty here lies in the use of such structures to select good metaphors and models and in the effects of the resulting power and efficiency on cognitive behavior. This paper describes a particular formalization of abstractions -in a knowledge representation system called ANALOG and shows how abstractions can be used in model building, understanding and generating analogies, and theory formation. The presentation here is necessarily brief and mentions only the highlights. The next section defines the notions of abstraction and simulation structure. Section 3 describes the use of abstractions in building computational models, and section 4 shows how abstractions can bc used to gain power as well as efficiency.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-058.pdf,

67,1980,Specialized Systems,Intelligent Retrieval Planning,Jonathan J. King,"Intelligent retrieval planning is the application of artificial intelligence techniques to the task of efficient retrieval of information from very large databases. Using such techniques, significant increases in efficiency can be obtained. Some of these improvements are not available through standard methods of database query optimization. Intelligent retrieval planning presents interesting issues related to other artificial intelligence planning research: planning with limited resources, optimizing the combined planning and execution process, and pursuing plans whose success depends upon the current contents of the database. An experimental system has been implemented to demonstrate the novel kinds of query optimizations and to test strategies for controlling the inference of constraints. The problem of query optimization has arisen with the development of high level logical data models and nonprocedural query languages. These free a user from the need to understand the physical organization of the database when posing a query. However, the user’s statement of the query may lead to very inefficient processing. Standard techniques of query optimization manipulate the set of retrieval operations contained in the query to find a relatively inexpensive sequence. The manipulations are independent of the meaning of the query, depending entirely on such factors as the size of the referenced files. The essential advance of intelligent retrieval planning over standard techniques of database query optimization is to combine knowledge about the semantics of the application domain with knowledge about the physical organization of the database. Domain knowledge makes it possible to use the constraints in a database query to infer additional constraints which the retrieved data must satisfy. These additional constraints may make it possible to use more efficient retrieval operations or permit the execution of a sequence of operations that has a lower cost. Knowledge of the physical organization of the database can be used to limit the attempts to make such inferences so that the combined process of retrieval and inference is cost effective.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-068.pdf,

83,1980,Applications,An Application of the Prospector System to DOE’s National Uranium Resource Evaluation,John Gaschnig,"A practical criterion for the success of a knowledge-based problem-solving system is its usefulness as a tool to those working in its specialized domain of expertise. Here we describe an application of the Prospector consultation system to the task of estimating the favorability of several test regions for occurrence of uranium deposits. This pilot study was conducted for the National Uranium Resource Estimate program of the U.S. Department of Energy. For credibility, the study was preceded by a performance evaluation of the relevant portion of Prospector’s knowledge base, which showed that Prospector’s conclusions agreed very closely with those of the model designer over a broad range of conditions and levels of detail. We comment on characteristics of the Prospector system that are relevant to the issue of inducing geologists to use the system.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-084.pdf,
84,1980,Applications,Some Requirements for a Computer-Based Legal Consultant,L. Thorne McCarty,"Although the literature on computer-based consultation systems has often suggested the possibility of building an expert system in the field of law it is only recently that several AI researchers have begun to explore this possibility seriously. Recent projects include: the development of a computational theory of legal reasoning, using corporate tax law as an experimental problem domain; the development of a language for expressing legal rules within a data-base management environment; the design of an information retrieval system based on a computer model of legal knowledge; and the design of an artificial intelligence system to analyze simple tort cases. This paper attempts to identify the principal obstacles to the development of a legal consultation system, given the current state of artificial intelligence research, and argues that there are only certain areas of the law which are amenable to such treatment at the present time. The paper then suggests several criteria for selecting the most promising areas of application, and indicates the kinds of results that might be expected, using our current work on the TAXMAN project as an example.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-085.pdf,
85,1980,Natural Language,When Expectation Fails: Towards a Self-Correcting Inference System,"R. H. Granger, Jr.","Contextual understanding depends on a reader’s ability to correctly infer a context within which to interpret the events in a story. This ""context-selection problem"" has traditionally been expressed in terms of heuristics for making the correct initial selection of a story context. This paper presents a view of context selection as an ongoing process spread throughout the understanding process. This view requires that the understander be capable of recognizing and correcting erroneous initial context inferences. A computer program called ARTHUR is described, which selects the correct context for a story by dynamically re-evaluating its own initial inferences in light of subsequent information in a story.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-086.pdf,
86,1980,Natural Language,Generating Relevant Explanations: Natural Language Responses to Questions about Database Structure,Kathleen R. McKeown,"The research described here is aimed at unresolved problems in both natural language generation and natural language interfaces to database systems. How relevant information is selected and then organized for the generation of responses to questions about database structure is examined. Due to limited space, this paper reports on only one method of explanation, called ""compare and contrast"". In particular, it describes a specific constraint on relevancy and organization that can be used for this response type.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-087.pdf,
87,1980,Natural Language,The Semantic Interpretation of Nominal Compounds,Timothy W. Finin,"This paper briefly introduces an approach to the problem of building semantic interpretations of nominal compounds, i.e. sequences of two or more nouns related through modification. Examples of the kinds of nominal compounds dealt with are: ""engine repairs"", ""aircraft flight arrival"", ""aluminum water pump"", and ""noun noun modification"".",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-088.pdf,
88,1980,Natural Language,Towards an AI Model of Argumentation,"Lawrence Birnbaum, Margot Flowers, Rod McGuire","This paper describes a process model of human argumentation, and provides examples of its operation as implemented in a computer program. Our main concerns include such issues as the rules and structures underlying argumentation, how these relate to conversational rules, how reasoning is used in arguments, and how arguing and reasoning interact.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-089.pdf,
89,1980,Natural Language,Knowledge Representation for Syntactic / Semantic Processing,"Robert J. Bobrow, Bonnie L. Webber","This paper describes the RUS framework for natural language processing, in which a parser incorporating a substantial ATN grammar for English interacts with a semantic interpreter to simultaneously parse and interpret input. The structure of that interaction is discussed, including the roles played by syntactic and semantic knowledge. Several implementations of the RUS framework are currently in use, sharing the same grammar, but differing in the form of their semantic component. One of these, the PSI-KLONE system, is based on a general object-centered knowledge representation system, called KL-ONE. The operations of PSI-KLONE is described, including its use of KL-ONE to support a general inference process called ""incremental description refinement."" The last section of the paper discusses several important criteria for knowledge representation systems to be used in syntactic and semantic processing.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-090.pdf,
90,1980,Natural Language,Language and Memory: Generalization as a Part of Understanding,Michael Lebowitz,"This paper presents the Integrated Parser (IPP), a computer model that combines text understanding and memory of events. An extended example of the program’s ability to understand newspaper stories and make generalizations that are useful for memory organization is presented.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-091.pdf,
91,1980,Natural Language,Failures in Natural Language Systems: Applications to Data Base Query Systems,Eric Mays,"A significant class of failures in interactions with data base query systems are attributable to misconceptions or incomplete knowledge regarding the domain of discourse on the part of the user. This paper describes several types of user failures, namely, intensional failures of presumptions. These failures are distinguished fran extensional failures of presumptions since they are dependent on the structure rather than the contents of the data base. A knowledge representation has been developed for the recognition of intensional failures that are due to the assumption of non-existent relationships between entities. Several other intensional failures which depend on more sophisticated knowledge representations are also discussed. Appropriate forms of corrective behavior are outlined which would enable the user to formulate queries directed to the solution of his/her particular task and compatible with the knowledge organization.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-092.pdf,
92,1980,Memory Models,Organizing Memory and Keeping It Organized,Janet L. Kolodner,Maintaining good memory organization is important in large memory systems. This paper presents a scheme for automatically reorganizing event information in memory. The processes are implemented in a computer program called CYRUS.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-093.pdf,
93,1980,Memory Models,Meta-Planning,Robert Wilensky,"This paper is concerned with the problems of planning and understanding. These problems are related because a natural language understander must apply knowledge about people’s goals and plans in order to make the inference necessary to explain the behavior of a character in a story. Thus while a story understander is not a planner, it must embody a theory of planning knowledge.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-094.pdf,
94,1980,Memory Models,Narrative Text Summarization,Wendy G. Lehnert,"In order to summarize a story it is necessary to access a high level analysis that highlights the story’s central concepts. A technique of memory representation based on affect units appears to provide the necessary foundation for such an analysis. Affect units are conceptual structures that overlap with each other when a narrative is cohesive. When overlapping intersections are interpreted as arcs in a graph of affect units, the resulting graph encodes the plot of the story. Structural features of the graph then reveal which concepts are central to the story. Affect unit analysis is currently being investigated as a processing strategy for narrative summarization.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1980/../../../Papers/AAAI/1980/AAAI80-095.pdf,
