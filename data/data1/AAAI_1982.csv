0,1982,Vision,The Role of Eye Position Information in Algorithms for Stereoscopic Matching,K. Prazdny,The viewing system parameters probably have to be explicitly taken into consideration in formulating computational solutions to the stereoscopic matching problem in binocular vision. An algorithm for computing the directions of gaze from purely visual information without a prior solution to the correspondence problem is outlined. It would seem that the availability of such (or similar) algorithm is a precondition for any stereo matching process using the epipolar constraint.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-001.pdf,
1,1982,Vision,Representing Smooth Plane Curves for Recognition: Implications for Figure-Ground Reversal,"D. D. Hoffman, W. A. Richards","A representation of smooth plane curves for recognition is proposed. The basic representation is a linked list of four primitive shapes, called ""codons,"" which are invariant under rotations, translations and uniform scaling. Psychophysical observations regarding the perception of figure- ground reversals are presented to suggest that a similar representation could be used by the human visual system.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-002.pdf,
2,1982,Vision,Why Perspective Is Difficult: How Two Algorithms Fail,John R. Kender,"Attempting to derive image algorithms solely under orthographic projection is deceptively easy. However, orthographic algorithms often fail when applied to the perspective case. More critically, since many things simplify under orthography, such algorithms often give no evidence for their proper extension. This paper gives two such examples, showing both the problems that arise for them under perspective, and the surprising extensions that they require.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-003.pdf,
3,1982,Vision,Tracking Known Three-Dimensional Objects,Donald B. Gennery,"A method of visually tracking a known three-dimensional object is described. Predicted object position and orientation extrapolated from previous tracking data are used to find known features in one or more pictures. The measured image positions of the features are used to adjust the estimates of object position, orientation, velocity, and angular velocity in three dimensions. Filtering over time is included as an integral part of the adjustment, so that the filtering both smooths as appropriate to the measurements and allows stereo depth information to be obtained from multiple cameras taking pictures of a moving object at different times.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-004.pdf,
4,1982,Vision,A Model Based Vision System for Recognition of Machine Parts,"Katsushi Ikeuchi, Yoshiaki Shirai",This paper describes a vision system based on the photometric stereo system and a model generator called GEOMAP. The photometric stereo system obtains a needle map from shading information of an observed image. An extended Gaussian image of the needle map reduces possible attitudes of an object relative to the viewer. A model-generator called GEOMAP generates a needle map which would be observed from the viewer direction determined from EGI. Comparing the needle map by the GEOMAP with the needle map by the photometric stereo system makes final recognition of the object.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-005.pdf,
5,1982,Vision,Local Computation of Shape,Alex Paul Pentland,"Local, parallel analysis of shading in an image may be used to infer surface shape without o priori knowledge about the viewed scene. The following has been proven: Given a reason- able assumption about surface smoothness, local analysis of the second derivative of image intensity allows the image-plane com- ponent of surface orientation to be determined exactly, and a maximum-likelihood estimate of the remaining depth component of orientation to be made. An algorithm has been developed to compute surface orientation, in parallel, for each image point without knowledge of scene characteristics. This algorithm has been evaluated on both natural and synthesized images, and produces a good estimate of shape.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-006.pdf,
6,1982,Vision,Edge Detection in Optical Flow Fields,"William B. Thompson, Kathleen M. Mutch, Valdis Berzins","Optical flow is potentially valuable as a source of spatial information. Current techniques provide flow fields which are noisy and sparse, making the recovery of spatial proper ties difficult at best. This paper describes a technique for locating discontinuities in optical flow, which typically correspond to object boundaries. A simple blurring interpolator is used to smooth out noise and produce denser fields. Discontinuities are found by locating the vector field equivalent of zero crossings in the Laplacian of a scalar field. The technique is illustrated by applying it to realistic vector fields which are both noisy and sparse.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-007.pdf,
7,1982,Vision,Modeling and Using Physical Constraints in Scene Analysis,"M. A. Fischler, S. T. Barnard, R. C. Bolles, M. Lowry, L. Quam, G. Smith, A. Witkin","This paper describes the results obtained in a research program ultimately concerned with deriving a physical sketch of a scene from one or more images. Our approach involves modeling physically meaningful information that can be used to constrain the interpretation process, as well as modeling the actual scene content. In particular, we address the problems of modeling the imaging process (camera and illumination), the scene geometry (edge classification and surface reconstruction), and elements of scene content (material composition and skyline delineation).",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-008.pdf,
8,1982,Vision,Intensity-Based Edge Classification,Andrew P. Witkin,"A new intensity-based approach to the classification of edges was developed and implemented. Using basic continuity and independence properties of scenes and images, signatures were deduced for each of several edge types expressed in terms of correlational properties of the image intensities in the neighborhood of the edge. This procedureâ€™s ability to discriminate occluding contours from cast shadow boundaries was demonstrated for cases where line junction cues are absent from the image.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-009.pdf,
9,1982,Vision,Segmentation of Images Into Regions Using Edge Information,Gerard G. Medioni,"A method for segmentation aerial images using edge information to create regions of similar or smoothly varying intensity is discussed. Region segmentation using edges directly as input cannot be successful because boundaries are seldom perfectly closed. In the present method, we preprocess the edge image to close gaps and create a binary image from which we extract the connected regions. We compare the results obtained with this method and a traditional region-splitting method for 2 different views of an aerial scene.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-010.pdf,
10,1982,Vision,A Corner Finding Algorithm for Image Analysis and Registration,"J.-Q. Fang, T. S. Huang","In our algorithm the gradient of 8 (the gradient direction) in a grey level image is employed for detecting candidates for corner points. Two theorems show that this quantity attains a local maximum at a corner point. Two approaches, median filtering and Hough transform are used effectively to distinguish corner points from noise points. The corner points formed by our algorithm are used in interframe matching.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-011.pdf,
11,1982,Vision,A Systematic Approach to Continuous Graph Labeling With Application to Computer Vision,"M. D. Diamond, N. Narasimhamurthi, S. Ganapathy","The discrete and continuous graph labeling problem are discussed. A basis for the continuous graph labeling problem is presented, in which an explicit connection between the discrete and continuous problems is made. The need for this basis is argued by noting conditions which must be satisfied before solutions can be pursued in a formal manner. Several cooperative solution algo- rithms based on the proposed formulation and results of the application of these algorithms to the problem of extracting line drawings are presented.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-012.pdf,
12,1982,Vision,Determining Surface Type From Surface Normals,"Paul Amaranth, William Jaynes","By exploiting the relationship which exists between the Gaussian image and gradient space, the two representations can be utilized in conjunction to facilitate the interpretation of a set of surface normals. The projection of the Gaussian image onto a plane can provide clear traces which quickly yield general knowledge of the underlying surface.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-013.pdf,
13,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Planning Natural-Language Utterances,Douglas E. Appelt,This paper describes recent research on a natural-language-generation system that is based on planning. A system named KAMP is described that is capable of producing English sentences as part of a plan to enlist the cooperation of another agent in achieving a goal involving a change in the physical state of the world. The planner uses knowledge about the different subgoals to be achieved and linguistic rules about English to produce sentences that satisfy multiple goals through the realization multiple illocutionary acts.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-014.pdf,
14,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Argument Molecules: A Functional Representation of Argument Structure,Lawrence Birnbaum,"Understanding an utterance in an argument crucially requires determining the evidential relations it bears to prior and subsequent propositions in the argument (Birnbaum et al., 1980; Cohen, 1981). The memory representation of an argument should, accordingly, indicate which propositions a given proposition counts as evidence for (a support relation) or against (an attack relation), and which propositions support or attack it in turn. The representation of an argument can thus be viewed as a network of propositions connected by support or attack relations (an argument graph). Although this sort of representation can be motivated simply by the need to represent the content of an argument, it seems natural to ask whether such argument graphs might further possess any useful structural properties, abstracted from the specific propositions they relate.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-015.pdf,
15,1982,Natural Language and Speech,ARGOT: The Rochester Dialogue System,"James F. Allen, Alan M. Frisch, Diane J. Litman","We are engaged in a long-term research project that has the ultimate aim of describing a mechanism that can partake in an extended English dialogue on some reasonably well specified range of topics.

It outlines the system and describes recent results as well as work in progress.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-016.pdf,
16,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Dividing Up the Question Answering Process,Marc Luria,"This paper describes a question answering program which divides question answering into two separate processes: answer formation and answer expression. Rather than gathering possible answers and choosing the best among them, the program accesses the database and finds all components of possible answers, e.g. a causal chain, and then passes this information to an expression program which formulates a proper answer.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-017.pdf,
17,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Salience as a Simplifying Metaphor for Natural Language Generation,"David D. McDonald, E. Jeffery Conklin","We have developed a simple yet effective technique for planning the generation of natural language texts that describe photographs of natural scenes as processed by the UMass VISIONS system. The texts follow the ordering on the sceneâ€™s objects that is imposed by their visual salience -- an ordering which we believe is naturally computed as a by-product of visual processing, and thus is available -- for free -- as the basis for generating simple but effective texts without requiring the complex planning machinery often applied in generation. We suggest that it should be possible to find structural analogs to visual salience in other domains and to build comparably simple generation schemes based on them. We look briefly at how one such analogy might be drawn for the task of tutoring novice PASCAL programmers.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-018.pdf,
18,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Conceptual Dependency and Montague Grammar: A Step Toward Conciliation,"Mark A. Jones, David S. Warren","In attempting to establish a common basis from which the approaches and results can be compared, we have taken a conciliatory attitude toward natural language research in the conceptual dependency (CD) paradigm and Montague Grammar (MG) formalism. Although these two approaches may seem to be strange bedfellows indeed with often noticeably different perspectives, we have observed many commonalities. We begin with a brief description of the problem view and ontology of each and then create a formulation of CD as logic. We then give ""conceptual"" MG translations for the words in an example sentence which we use in approximating a word-based parsing style. Finally, we make some suggestions regarding further extensions of logic to introduce higher level representations.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-019.pdf,
19,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Event Shape Diagrams,D. L. Waltz,"""Event shape diagrams"" are proposed as a representation for capturing the nuances of meaning of verbs that describe similar events. These diagrams represent timing, causal relationships between case roles, and typical value ranges for role fillers. Event shape diagrams are expressed in terms of primitive predicates and timing information that we believe could be computed by perceptual systems, and are intended to be a step toward the eventual connection of language systems to perceptual (vision, hearing, and touch) sensing systems. The diagrams are capable of representing modification of verbs by adverbs, can support judgements of the degree of plausibility of various interpretations of a sentenceâ€™s meaning, and may be useful in figuring out the meaning of certain kinds of metaphors.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-020.pdf,
20,1982,Natural Language and Speech,An Explanation for Minimal Attachment and Right Association,Robert W. Milne,This paper describes the principles of Right Association and Minimal Attachment and explains how the Sausage Machine and ATN decribe these principles. It is then shown that these two models cannot explain these principles. It is then shown that a production system grammar can both describe these principles as well as suggest why they must be true.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-021.pdf,
21,1982,Natural Language and Speech,A Synthetic Approach to Temporal Information Processing,Mark D. Grover,"A representation and processing scheme for temporal (time-based) information is presented. Previous computer science approaches to temporal information processing are analyzed. Linguistic analysis of tense, aspect and temporal adverbials provide motivation for an automated general temporal understanding system. A synthetic approach is proposed, combining possible-worlds branching time theory with inertia futures, elements of Montague Grammar, a four-valued logic and the interval semantics time model. Key portions of the model are implemented and demonstrated in a PASCAL program.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-022.pdf,
22,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Word Sense and Case Slot Disambiguation,"Graeme Hirst, Eugene Charniak","The tasks of disambiguating words and determining case are similar and can usefully be combined. We present two cooperating mechanisms that each work on both tasks: MARKER PASSING finds connections between concepts in a system of frames, and POLAROID WORDS provide a protocol for negotiation between ambiguous words and cases. Examples of each in action are given. The cooperating mechanisms allow Iinguistic and world knowledge to be unified, frequently eliminate the need to use inference in disambiguation, and provide a usefully constrained model of disambiguation.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-023.pdf,
23,1982,Natural Language and Speech,Word Learning With Hierarchy-Guided Inference,David M. Keirsey,A technique for learning new words is discussed. The technique uses expectations generated by the context and an ISA hierarchy to guide the inference process.

26,1982,Problem Solving and Search,A Search Procedure for Perfect Information Games of Chance: Its Formulation and Analysis,Bruce W. Ballard,"An algorithm is developed for searching the trees of ""perfect information"" games involving chance events. Many dice games (e.g. backgammon, craps, and monopoly and similar board games), and some card games (e.g. casino blackjack), have this property. For depth 3 trees, empirical observation reveals a search reduction of more than 50 percent, while closed-form analysis reveals a best-case complexity of O(N**2). This represents a substantial savings over the O(N**3) behavior of the ""obvious"" search strategy.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-027.pdf,
27,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Synchronization of Multi-Agent Plans,Jeffrey S. Rosenschein,"Consider an intelligent agent constructing a plan to be executed by several other agents; correct plan execution will often require that actions be taken in a specific sequence. Therefore, the planner cannot simply tell each agent what action to perform; explicit mechanisms must exist for maintaining the execution sequence. This paper outlines such mechanisms. A framework for multiple-agent planning is developed, consisting of several parts. First, a formalism is adopted for representing knowledge about other agentsâ€™ beliefs and goals, and is extended to allow representation of their capabilities. Communication primitives are defined that allow selective acceptance of goals and facts, and an explicit means of inducing an agent to perform an act is introduced. Finally, the ordering mechanisms (consisting of sequencing operators and a planning heuristic) arc presented, along with a specific example of their use.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-028.pdf,

29,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Evaluating Search Methods Analytically,"Paul W. Purdom, Jr., Cynthia A. Brown",A unified approach to analyzing search algorithms is presented.

30,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Consistent-Labeling Problems and Their Algorithms,Bernard Nudel,"Two new classes of theories have been developed giving the expected complexities of three Consistent-Labeling Problem (CLP), or Constraint-Satisfaction, algorithms: Backtracking, Forward Checking and Word-wise Forward Checking. Apart from giving the exact expected complexity for these algorithms for the underlying CLP distribution and domain, these theories provide useful approximations for the complexity of solving essentially any individual CLP. Given this, and the fact that the theories can reflect changes in complexity due to changes in the ordering of variables used in the search, these theories have the potential to afford significant savings for any individual CLP, by predicting, prior to search, good orderings for use in solving that CLP. We are concurrently developing improved CLP algorithms based on this and similar ordering effects.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-031.pdf,

The computational scheme proposed specifies a set of belief parameters, communication messages and updating rules which guarantee that the diffusion of updated beliefs is accomplished in a single pass and complies with the tenets of Bayes calculus.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-032.pdf,
32,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Diagnosis Based on Description of Structure and Function,"Randall Davis, Howard Shrobe, Walter Hamscher, KÃ¤ren Wieckert, Mark Shirley, Steve Polit","While expert systems have traditionally been built using large collections of rules based on empirical associations, interest has grown recently in the use of systems that reason from representations of structure and function. Our work explores the use of such models in troubleshooting digital electronics. We describe our work to date on (i) a language for describing structure, (ii) a language for describing function, and (iii) a set of principles for troubleshooting that uses the two descriptions to guide its investigation. In discussing troubleshooting we show why the traditional approach --- test generation --- solves a different problem and we discuss a number of its practical shortcomings. We consider next the style of debugging known as violated expectations and demonstrate why it is a fundamental advance over traditional test generation. Further exploration of this approach, however, demonstrates that it is incapable of dealing with commonly known classes of faults. We explain the shortcoming as arising from the use of a fault model that is both implicit and inseparable from the basic troubleshooting methodology. We argue for the importance of fault models that are explicit, separated from the troubleshooting mechanism, and retractable in much the same sense that inferences are retracted in current systems.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-033.pdf,
33,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Unifying Data-Directed and Goal-Directed Control: An Example and Experiments,"Daniel D. Corkill, Victor R. Lesser, Eva Hudlicka","Effective control in a multi-level cooperating knowledge source problem solver (such as Hearsay-II) requires the system to reason about the relationships among competing and cooperating knowledge source (KS) instantiations (both past and potential) that are working on different aspects and levels of the problem. Such reasoning is needed to assess the current state of problem solving and to develop plans for using the systemâ€™s limited processing resources to the best advantage. The relationships among KS instantations can be naturally represented when KS activity is viewed simultaneously from a data-directed and a goal-directed perspective. In this paper we show how data- and goal-directed control can be integrated into a single, uniform framework, and we present an example and experimental results of sophisticated focusing using this framework.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-034.pdf,

The algorithm effectively integrates bottom-up information in the form of letter shapes, letter transitional probabilities and letter classification-error probabilities together with top-down knowledge in the form of a lexicon of legal words represented as a letter trie. Experimental results with the algorithm are reported for the combined top-down and bottom-up approach and for each of the two approaches individually.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-035.pdf,

37,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Heuretics: Theoretical and Experimental Study of Heuristic Rules,Douglas B. Lenat,"Builders of expert rule-based systems [Barr 81] [Feigenbaum 77] [Hayes-Roth et al. 82] attribute the impressive performance of their programs to the corpus of knowledge they embody: a large network of facts to provide breadth of scope, and a large array of informal judgmental rules (heuristics) which guide the system toward plausible paths to follow and away from implausible ones. Yet what is the nature of heuristics? What is the source of their power? How do thev interreIate; i.e., how can/should a large corpus of heuristic rules be organized? How do heuristics originate and evolve? ""Heuretics"" is the study of heuristics, with an eye toward answering questions such as those. Two case studies, the AM and EURISKO programs, have led to some tentative Heuretics hypotheses, a dozen of which are presented in this paper.

40,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Error Detection and Recovery in a Dynamic Planning Environment,"Blake Ward, Gordon McCalla","In this paper a set of techniques for error detection and recovery is proposed. These techniques augment a planning system (the ELMER system) which already has many features for preventing execution errors but has few features for handling errors that canâ€™t be prevented. The error handling techniques presented in this paper depend for their effectiveness on the close co-operation of the planning, execution and knowledge base components of the systeti, and especially make use of knowledge learned from the earlier execution of other plans.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-041.pdf,
41,1982,Problem Solving and Search,Scenarios as an Aid to Planning,"Rajendra S. Wall, Edwina L.

Rather than attempt to produce such detailed solutions, we propose an alternative of using scenarios: a set of ""snapshots"" of the future that outline possible courses of action, actions of foreign processes, and their consequences. In this paper, we present the scenario idea and discuss its use as an aid to tactical planning. We discuss an implementation of these ideas in a Tactical Assistant to aid planning in the errand running and conflict simulation game domains and present an example illustrative of its capabilities.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-042.pdf,
42,1982,Problem Solving and Search,A Framework for Distributed Problem Solving,"Dave McArthur, Randy Steeb, Stephanie Cammarata",Situations in which several agents must interact to achieve goals present difficulties of coordination and cooperation not found in single-agent problem solving contexts. Techniques for coordination and cooperation required in group problem solving are not well understood because most AI models deal with cases in which problems are solved by a single agent. In this paper we present a framework for distributed problem solving that describes some of the expertise an agent working in a multi-agent environment must have. An application of the framework to the domain of air-traffic control is discussed. Here each aircraft is viewed as an agent that must cooperate with others to achieve a conflict-free plan.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-043.pdf,

44,1982,Knowledge Representation,Competence in Knowledge Representation,"Ronald J. Brachman, Hector J. Levesque","The range of domains and tasks for ""knowledge-based systems"" has been expanding at a furious pace. As we move away from trivial domains, such as the ""blocks world,"" the demands on knowledge representation systems used by expert programs are becoming more extreme. For one thing, the domains themselves are getting so complex that specialized technical vocabularies are unavoidable; consequently, the issue of a system talking with un expert in his own language cannot be ignored. For another, tasks such as medical diagnosis, scene analysis, speech understanding, and game playing all have as a central feature an incrementally evolving model representing probably incomplete knowledge of part of the task domain. In this paper, we explore some of the impact of these two critical issues -- complexity and incompleteness -- on knowledge representation systems. We review some aspects of current representation research that offer a foundation for coping with these problems, and finally suggest a way of integrating these ideas into a powerful, practical knowledge representation paradigm.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-045.pdf,

An example is given of a recently implemented hybrid system in which a specialized planning language co-exists with its translation into predicate calculus. In this system, various kinds of reasoning required for a program understanding task are implemented at either the predicate calculus level or the planning language level, depending on which is more natural.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-046.pdf,

It has a mechanism for maintaining consistency in the representation and discovering the origin of inconsistencies. Further, its deduction mechanisms for intervals are easily extended to deal with time points.

Through this mechanism some proof methods can be utilized that had been unavailable to an earlier prover that was not agenda-based. One approach allows information discovered in one path in an attempted proof to trigger a case split in another part of the attempted proof (NONLOCAL CASE SPLIT).

Lisp objects and objects in AI representation languages are treated uniformly; this makes program code independent of the data representation used, and permits changes of representation without changing code. GLISPâ€™s object description language provides a powerful abstract datatype facility which allows the structures and properties of objects to be dcscribcd. Reference to objects is permitted in an English-like syntax, including definite reference relative to the current context of the computation. Object-centered programming is supported. When interfaced to a hierarchical representation language, GLISP can perform inheritance at compile time, resulting in substantial performance improvements. In addition, a LISP structure can be specified as the way of implementing a class of objects in the representation language, making simple objects efficient in both time and storage.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-057.pdf,

This problem involves both human factors and algorithmic problems. From the human factors standpoint, what kind of route is best: shortest distance, most concise directions, fewest turns, or some combination of these? And from the algorithmic standard, what is a good shortest-path algorithm: breadth-first search, depth-first search, pre-storing important routes, divide and conquer, or keep a hierarchy of maps with progressively fewer streets? We implemented breadth-first and depth-first search both single-ended and double-ended. Double-ended search was faster in 14 of 16 examples and produced shorter or equal length routes in 13 of 16. Depth-first search was always faster than breadth-first, and produced shorter routes half the time. We also asked eight subjects for directions on 4 maps. The 32 tries at 4 problems produced 22 different routes. Peopleâ€™s strategies typically include finding main roads, and applying divide-and-conquer as well as depth-first search.

Novices, on the other hand, are good at dealing with typical problems or ""classic"" cases, but not novel problems. In people, the evolution from novice to expert happens as a result of being able to introspect and examine the knowledge used in solving problems. That introspection and examination allows people to learn from experience. A human expert can interpret a new case in terms of something (either a previous case or generalized knowledge) he is already familiar with. This implies that as an expert is having new experiences, he is evaluating and understanding them in terms of past experiences. In the process, he is integrating the new experience into his memory so that it too will be accessible to use in understanding a later case.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-066.pdf,

The system, named RABBIT, relies upon a new paradigm for retrieval, retrieval by reformulation, based on a psychological theory of human remembering. To make a query, the user interactively constructs a description of his target item(s) by criticizing successive example (and counterexample) instances. One of the key innovations in RABBIT is that instances from the database are presented to the user from a well-defined perspective inferred from the userâ€™s query description and the structure of the knowledge base. Among other things, this constructed perspective prevents the user from creating semantically improper query descriptions. RABBIT particularily facilitates users who approach a database with only a vague idea of what it is that they want and who thus, need to be guided in the (re)formulation of their queries.

86,1982,Medical,An Overview of ONIX,"David Barstow, Roger Duffey, Stephen Smoliar, Stanley Vestal","ONIX is an automatic programming system being developed for use by petroleum scientists who may not be knowledgable about computers. As a first step, a system has been implemented to assist in the trial-and-error process of developing new models and techniques for quantitative interpretation of well logs. The user interface exploits graphical techniques to enable petroleum scientists to describe their models in the natural concepts of the domain. The resulting specification can be implemented in any of several different target languages. The system is in active use by petroleum scientists, who find that it has significantly reduced the time to get feedback on hypothesized models.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-087.pdf,
87,1982,Medical,ARBY: Diagnosis With Shallow Causal Models,"Drew McDermott, Ruven Brooks","Arby is a software system or higher order language for writing expert systems to do diagnosis in electronic systems. As such, it is similar to EMYCIN (Van Melle 1982) in application, but quite different in design. It is rule-based to an extent, but the rules are written in predicate calculus. It resembles Caduceus (Pople 1977) in its mechanisms for refining and combining hypotheses.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-088.pdf,
88,1982,Medical,Graphical Animation From Knowledge,Daniel Neiman,A system is described which produces explanatory animation sequences for a small CAD system. The animation is data-driven from a scriptal knowledge structure describing the user-system interaction for a given design operation. The use of a unified data representation scheme results in the potential to generate animation in coordination with natural language output from an existing knowledge-based system.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-089.pdf,
89,1982,Robotics,The CMU Rover,Hans P. Moravec,"An advanced camera-equipped mobile robot is being built at the CMU Robotics Institute to support research in control, perception, planning and related issues. It will be used initially to continue and extend visual navigation work (the Cart Project) completed in 1981 at Stanfordâ€™s AI Lab, but is designed with mechanical, sensor and controller flexibility which should permit it to support a wide variety of other efforts.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-090.pdf,
90,1982,Robotics,Solving the Find-Path Problem by Good Representation of Free Space,Rodney A. Brooks,Free space is represented as a union of (possibly overlapping) generalized cones. An algorithm is presented which efficiently finds good collision free paths for convex polygonal bodies through space Iittered with obstacle polygons. The paths are good in the sense that the distance of closest approach to an obstacle over the path is usually far from minimal over the class of topologically equivalent collision free paths. The algorithm is based on characterizing the volume swept by a body as it is translated and rotated as a generalized cone and determining under what conditions one generalized cone is a subset of another.,https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-091.pdf,
91,1982,Robotics,Final Position Control in Planar Horizontal Arm Movements,Jonathan Delatizky,"Simplified control strategies based on the concept of ""Final Position Control"" for free reaching movements of the human upper limb have been simulated in a model incorporating six lumped muscles. The resulting movement repertoires bear some resemblance to normal human movements, but do not provide a complete explanation for observed behavior. The significance of these findings are discussed, and some implications for manipulator control are suggested.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-092.pdf,
92,1982,Robotics,Development of an Overall Direction-of-Action Sensor for Robots,Tokuji Okada,"Development of an optical sensor for measuring overall direction-of-action is treated. The measurement principle is based on distortions found in the projected image of a ball moving freely in a spherical vessel under the influence of the acceleration of gravity and motion. The measurement is carried out in a static condition. Thus, the sensor output stands for the direction of the gravitational field. Experimental results are presented to show that the angular errors are within 12 degrees for the overall direction. This sensor can be widely applied for measuring angular variations from the direction of the gravitational field.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-093.pdf,

94,1982,Robotics,Stability of Automatic Guidance for a Mobile Robot,L. Y. Shih,"A control law for the automatic guidance is proposed in this paper as if each obstacle exerts upon the mobile robot a repulsion, which varies inversely with the distance between the robot and the obstacle, and becomes infinite as the robot approaches the obstacle. Stability of the automatic guidance is studied when the mobile robot deviates from the ideal path. The results lead to criteria of selecting control parameters for better guidance.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-095.pdf,
95,1982,Program Synthesis and Understanding,Using Temporal Abstraction to Understand Recursive Programs Involving Side Effects,"Joachim Laubsch, Marc Eisenstadt","This paper develops the notion of temporal abstraction, used originally for the automatic understanding of looping constructs, to account for a class of recursive programs involving side effects upon a relational data base. The programs may involve compositions of several side effects, and these side effects can occur either during descent or upon ascent from recursive calls.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-096.pdf,
96,1982,Program Synthesis and Understanding,GIST English Generator,Bill Swartout,"This paper describes a prototype English generator which can produce English descriptions of program specifications written in Gist, a program specification language being developed at ISI. Such a facility is required because although Gist is a high level specification language, specifications written in it, like those in all other formal specification languages, are unreadable. There are several reasons for this unreadability: strange syntax; redundancy elimination; lack of thematic structure; implicit remote interactions; no representation of the motivation or rationale behind the specification; and a strict reliance on textual presentation. The current generator deals with the first two problems and part of the third. Our plans for dealing with the rest are outlined after a description of the current generator.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-097.pdf,
97,1982,Knowledge Acquisition,Automatic Schema Acquisition in a Natural Language Environment,Gerald DeJong,"This paper outlines an approach to schema acquisition. The approach, called explanatory schema acquisition is applicable in problems solving situations and is heavily knowledge-based. Basically, learning is viewed as a fundamental part of the understanding process. Understanding a situation for which there is no existing schema involves generalizing the new event into a nascent schema. The new schema is then available to aid in future processing and can be further refined via that processing. This approach to learning is unique in several respects: it is not inductive and so is capable of one trial learning, it does not depend on failures to drive the learning process, and it is incremental and learns comparatively slowly. The learning procedure is outlined briefly with an example, a taxonomy of situations involving explanatory schema acquisition is given, and there is a brief discussion on the scope of the learning mechanism.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-098.pdf,
98,1982,Knowledge Acquisition,Acquisition of Appropriate Bias for Inductive Concept Learning,"Paul E. Utgoff, Tom M. Mitchell","Current approaches to inductive concept learning suffer from a fundamental difficulty; if a fixed language is chosen in which to represent concepts, then in cases where that language is inappropriate, the new concept may be impossible to describe (and therefore to learn). We suggest a framework for automatically extending the language in which concepts are to be expressed. This framework includes multiple sources of knowledge for recommending plausible language extensions.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-099.pdf,
99,1982,Theoretical Foundations,Circumscription Implies Predicate Completion (Sometimes),Raymond Reiter,"Predicate completion is an approach to closed world reasoning which assumes that the given sufficient conditions on a predicate are also necessary. Circumscription is a formal device characterizing minimal reasoning i.e. reasoning in minimal models, and is realized by an axiom schema. The basic result of this paper is that for first order theories which are Horn in a predicate P, the circumscription of P logically implies Pâ€™s completion axiom.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-100.pdf,
100,1982,Theoretical Foundations,Monitors as Responses to Questions: Determining Competence,Eric Mays,This paper discusses the application of a propositional temporal logic to determining the competence of a monitor offer as an extended response by a question-answering system.

101,1982,Theoretical Foundations,A Systematic Approach to Continuous Graph Labeling With Application to Computer Vision,"M. D. Diamond, N. Narasimhamurthi, S. Ganapathy","The discrete and continuous graph labeling problem are discussed. A basis for the continuous graph labeling problem is presented, in which an explicit connection between the discrete and continuous problems is made. The need for this basis is argued by noting conditions which must be satisfied before solutions can be pursued in a formal manner. Several cooperative solution algo- rithms based on the proposed formulation and results of the application of these algorithms to the problem of extracting line drawings are presented.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-012.pdf,
102,1982,Theoretical Foundations,The Role of Logic in Knowledge Representation and Commonsense Reasoning,Robert C. Moore,"This paper examines the role that formal logic ought to play in representing and reasoning with commonsense knowledge. We take issue with the commonly held view (as expressed by Newell [1980]) that the use of representations based on formal logic is inappropriate in most applications of artificial intelligence. We argue to the contrary that there is an important set of issues, involving incomplete knowledge of a problem situation, that so far have been addressed only by systems based on formal logic and deductive inference, and that, in some sense, probably can be dealt with only by systems based on logic and deduction. We further argue that the experiments of the late 1960s on problem-solving by theorem-proving did not show that the use of logic and deduction in AI systems was necessarily inefficient, but rather that what was needed was better control of the deduction process, combined with more attention to the computational properties of axioms.",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-103.pdf,
103,1982,Theoretical Foundations,Foundations of Envisioning,"Johan de Kleer, John Seely Brown","This paper explores a particular kind of qualitative reasoning, called envisioning, that is capable of producing causal explanations for device behavior. It has been implemented in a computer program, ENVISION, which can analyze a wide variety of thermal, fluid, electrical, translational and rotational devices. Rather than present the technical details of the envisioning process, this paper examines the theoretical foundations upon which it is built. Many of these considerations are ones that any builder of qualitative reasoning systems must pay attention to. Two such considerations are explanation and robustness: What notion of causality is adequate for causal explanations of device behavior? How can there be any confidence in the analysis of a novel device?",https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1982/../../../Papers/AAAI/1982/AAAI82-104.pdf,
