1,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Exploiting Monotonicity in Interval Constraint Propagation,"Ignacio Araya, Gilles Trombettoni, Bertrand Neveu","We propose in this paper a new interval constraint propagation algorithm, called MOnotonic Hull Consistency (Mohc), that exploits monotonicity of functions. The propagation is standard, but the Mohc-Revise procedure, used to filter/contract the variable domains w.r.t. an individual constraint, uses monotonic versions of the classical HC4-Revise and BoxNarrow procedures.   Mohc-Revise appears to be the first adaptive revise procedure ever proposed in (interval) constraint programming.Â  Also, when a function is monotonic w.r.t. every variable, Mohc-Revise is proven to compute the optimal/sharpest box enclosing all the solutions of the corresponding constraint (hull consistency). Very promising experimental results suggest that Mohc has the potential to become an alternative to the state-of-the-art HC4 and Box algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1699/1911,constraint propagation; intervals; monotonicity
2,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",A Restriction of Extended Resolution for Clause Learning SAT Solvers,"Gilles Audemard, George Katsirelos, Laurent Simon","Modern complete SAT solvers almost uniformly implement variations of the clause learning framework introduced by Grasp and Chaff. The success of these solvers has been theoretically explained by showing that the clause learning framework is an implementation of a proof system which is as poweful as resolution. However, exponential lower bounds are known for resolution, which suggests that significant advances in SAT solving must come from implementations of more powerful proof systems.  We present a clause learning SAT solver that uses extended resolution. It is based on a restriction of the application of the extension rule.  This solver outperforms existing solvers on application instances from recent SAT competitions as well as on instances that are provably hard for resolution.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1811/1912,satisfiability; resolution
3,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Transmission Network Expansion Planning with Simulation Optimization,"Russell Bent, Alan Berscheid, G. Loren Toole","Within the electric power literature the transmission expansion planning problem (TNEP) refers to the problem of how to upgrade an electric power network to meet future demands. As this problem is a complex, non-linear, and non-convex optimization problem, researchers have traditionally focused on approximate models of power flows. Existing approaches are often tightly coupled to the approximation choice. Until recently, these approximations have produced results that are straight-forward to adapt to the more complex (real) problem. However, the power grid is evolving towards a state where the adaptations are no longer easy (e.g. large amounts of limited control, renewable generation) that necessitates new optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a local search variation of the powerful Limited Discrepancy Search (LDLS) that encapsulates the complexity of power flows in a black box that may be queried for information about the quality of a proposed expansion. This allows the development of a new optimization algorithm that is    independent of the underlying power model.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1685/1913,transmission network expansion planning;tnep;local search; simulation optimization
4,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Propagating Conjunctions of AllDifferent Constraints,"Christian Bessiere, George Katsirelos, Nina Narodytska, Claude-Guy Quimper, Toby Walsh","We study propagation algorithms for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. Solutions of an AllDifferent constraint can be seen as perfect matchings on the variable/value bipartite graph. Therefore, we investigate the problem of finding simultaneous bipartite matchings. We present an extension of the famous Hall theorem which characterizes when simultaneous bipartite matchings exists. Unfortunately, finding such matchings is NP-hard in general. However, we prove a surprising result that finding a simultaneous matching on a convex bipartite graph takes just polynomial time. Based on this theoretical result, we provide the first polynomial time bound consistency algorithm for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. We identify a pathological problem on which this propagator is exponentially faster compared to existing propagators. Our experiments show that this new propagator can offer significant benefits over existing methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1815/1916,constraint programming; constraint satisfaction; computational complexity; global constraints
5,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Independent Additive Heuristics Reduce Search Multiplicatively,"Teresa Maria Breyer, Richard Korf","This paper analyzes the performance of IDA* using additive heuristics. We show that the reduction in the number of nodes expanded using multiple independent additive heuristics is the product of the reductions achieved by the individual heuristics. First, we formally state and prove this result on unit edge-cost undirected graphs with a uniform branching factor. Then, we empirically verify it on a model of the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem. We also run experiments on the multiple sequence alignment problem showing more general applicability to non-unit edge-cost directed graphs. Then, we extend an existing model to predict the performance of IDA* with a single pattern database to independent additive disjoint pattern databases. This is the first analysis of the performance of independent additive heuristics.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1787/1919,
6,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",1.6-Bit Pattern Databases,"Teresa Maria Breyer, Richard Korf","We present a new technique to compress pattern databases to provide consistent heuristics without loss of information. We store the heuristic estimate modulo three, requiring only two bits per entry or in a more compact representation, only 1.6 bits. This allows us to store a pattern database with more entries in the same amount of memory as an uncompressed pattern database. These compression techniques are most useful where lossy compression using cliques or their generalization is not possible or where adjacent entries in the pattern database are not highly correlated. We compare both techniques to the best existing compression methods for the Top-Spin puzzle, Rubik's cube, the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem, and the 24 puzzle. Under certain conditions, our best implementations for the Top-Spin puzzle and Rubik's cube outperform the respective state of the art solvers by a factor of four.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1850/1920,
7,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",EWLS: A New Local Search for Minimum Vertex Cover,"Shaowei Cai, Kaile Su, Qingliang Chen","A number of algorithms have been proposed for the Minimum Vertex  Cover problem. However, they are far from satisfactory, especially  on hard instances. In this paper, we introduce Edge Weighting Local  Search (EWLS), a new local search algorithm for the Minimum Vertex  Cover problem. EWLS is based on the idea of extending a partial  vertex cover into a vertex cover. A key point of EWLS is to find a  vertex set that provides a tight upper bound on the size of the  minimum vertex cover. To this purpose, EWLS employs an iterated  local search procedure, using an edge weighting scheme which updates  edge weights when stuck in local optima. Moreover, some  sophisticated search strategies have been taken to improve the  quality of local optima. Experimental results on the broadly used  DIMACS benchmark show that EWLS is competitive with the current best  heuristic algorithms, and outperforms them on hard instances.  Furthermore, on a suite of difficult benchmarks, EWLS delivers the  best results and sets a new record on the largest instance.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1679/1921,Minimum Vertex Cover; Local Search; Edge Weighting
8,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",High-Quality Policies for the Canadian Traveler's Problem,"Patrick Eyerich, Thomas Keller, Malte Helmert","We consider the stochastic variant of the Canadian Traveler's Problem, a path planning problem where adverse weather can cause some roads to be untraversable. The agent does not initially know which roads can be used. However, it knows a probability distribution for the weather, and it can observe the status of roads incident to its location. The objective is to find a policy with low expected travel cost.We introduce and compare several algorithms for the stochastic CTP. Unlike the optimistic approach most commonly considered in the literature, the new approaches we propose take uncertainty into account explicitly. We show that this property enables them to generate policies of much higher quality than the optimistic one, both theoretically and experimentally.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1735/1922,Canadian Traveler's Problem; UCT; hindsight optimization
9,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Single-Frontier Bidirectional Search,"Ariel Felner, Carsten Moldenhauer, Nathan Sturtevant, Jonathan Schaeffer","On the surface, bidirectional search (BDS) is an attractive idea with the potential for significant asymptotic reductions in search effort. However, the results in practice often fall far short of expectations. We introduce a new bidirectional search algorithm, Single-Frontier Bidirectional Searc (SFBDS). Unlike traditional BDS which keeps two frontiers, SFBDS uses a single frontier. Each node in the tree can be seen as an independent task of finding the shortest path between the current start and current goal. At a particular node we can decide to search from start to goal or from goal to start, choosing the direction with the highest potential for minimizing the total work done. Theoretical results give insights as to when this approach will work and experimental data validates the algorithm for a broad range of domains.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1824/1923,search;heuristics
10,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Fast Local Search Algorithm for Weighted Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments,"Fedor Fomin, Daniel Lokshtanov, Venkatesh Raman, Saket Saurabh","We present a fast local search algorithm that finds an improved solution (if there is any) in the k-exchange neighborhood of the given solutionto an instance of Weighted Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments. More precisely,given an arc weighted tournament T on n vertices and a feedback arc set  F (a set of arcs whose deletion from T turns it into a directed acyclic graph), our algorithm  decides in time O(2o(k) n log n) if there is a feedback arc set of smaller weight and that differs from F in at most k arcs. To our knowledge this is the first algorithm searching the k-exchange neighborhood of an NP-complete problem that runs in (parameterized) subexponential time. Using this local search algorithm for  Weighted Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments, we obtain subexponential time algorithms for a local search variant of Kemeny Ranking â a problem in social choice theory and of One-Sided Cross Minimization â a problem in graph drawing.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1829/1924,Constraints;  Satisfiability;  Search; Social Choice;
11,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Exploiting QBF Duality on a Circuit Representation,"Alexandra Goultiaeva, Fahiem Bacchus","Search based solvers for Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) have adapted the SAT solver techniques of unit propagation and clause learning to prune falsifying assignments. The technique of cube learning has been developed to help them prune satisfying assignments. Cubes, however, have not been able to achieve the same degree of effectiveness as clauses.  In this paper we demonstrate how a circuit representation for QBF can support the propagation of dual truth values. The dual values support the identical techniques of unit propagation and clause learning, except now it is satisfying assignments rather than falsifying assignments that are pruned. Dual value propagation thus exploits the circuit representation and the duality of QBF formulas so that the same effective SAT techniques can now be used to prune both falsifying and satisfyingly assignments. We show empirically that dual propagation yields significantperformance improvements and advances the state of the art in QBF solving.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1791/1928,
12,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Symmetry in Solutions,"Marijn Heule, Toby Walsh","We define the concept of an internal symmetry. This is a symmety within a solution of a constraint satisfaction problem. We compare this to solution symmetry, which is a mapping between different solutions of the same problem. We argue that we may be able to exploit both types of symmetry when finding  solutions. We illustrate the potential of exploiting internal symmetries on two benchmark domains: Van der Waerden numbers and graceful graphs. By identifying internal symmetries we are able to extend the state of the art in both cases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1794/1931,Symmetry; constraint programming; constraint satisfaction; graceful labelling; Van der Waerden
13,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Optimal Rectangle Packing on Non-Square Benchmarks,"Eric Huang, Richard E. Korf","The rectangle packing problem consists of finding an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can contain a given set of rectangles without overlap. We propose two new benchmarks, one where the orientation of the rectangles is fixed and one where it is free, that include rectangles of various aspect ratios. The new benchmarks avoid certain properties of easy instances, which we identify as instances where rectangles have dimensions in common or where a few rectangles occupy most of the area. Our benchmarks are much more difficult for the previous state-of-the-art solver, requiring orders of magnitude more time, compared to similar-sized instances from a popular benchmark consisting only of squares. On the new benchmarks, we improve upon the previous strategy used to handle dominance conditions, we define a variable order over non-square rectangles that generalizes previous strategies, and we present a way to adjust the sizes of intervals of values for each rectangle's x-coordinates. Using these techniques together, we can solve the new oriented benchmark about 500 times faster, and the new unoriented benchmark about 40 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1678/1933,search; constraint satisfaction; scheduling; rectangle packing

The existing planning as satisfiability techniques usually use encodings compiled from the STRIPS formalism. We introduce a novel SAT encoding scheme based on the SAS+ formalism. It exploits the structural information in the SAS+ formalism, resulting in more compact SAT instances and reducing the number of clauses by up to 50 fold. Our results show that this encoding scheme improves upon the STRIPS-based encoding, in terms of both time and memory efficiency.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1764/1934,Planning; Satisfiability; Encoding;
15,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Parallel Depth First Proof Number Search,Tomoyuki Kaneko,"The depth first proof number search (df-pn) is an effective and popular algorithm for solving and-or tree problems by using proof and disproof numbers.  This paper presents a simple but effective parallelization of the df-pn search algorithm for a shared-memory system. In this parallelization, multiple agents autonomously conduct the df-pn with a shared transposition table. For effective cooperation of agents, virtual proof and disproof numbers are introduced for each node, which is an estimation of future proof and disproof numbers by using the number of agents working on the node's descendants as a possible increase. Experimental results on large checkmate problems in shogi, which is a popular chess variant in Japan, show that reasonable increases in speed were achieved with small overheads in memory.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1801/1935,df-pn; game programming; shogi

Choueiry, Christian Bessiere","Consistency properties and algorithms for achieving them are at the heart of the success of Constraint Programming. In this paper, we study the relational consistency property R(*,m)C, which is equivalent to m-wise consistency proposed in relational databases. We also define wR(*,m)C, a weaker variant of this property.  We propose an algorithm for enforcing these properties on a Constraint Satisfaction Problem by tightening the existing relations and without introducing new ones.  We empirically show that wR(*,m)C solves in a backtrack-free manner all the instances of some CSP benchmark classes, thus hinting at the tractability of those classes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1594/1936,CSP; non-binary constraints; local consistency; relational consistency; search; backtracking
17,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search","Dealing with Infinite Loops, Underestimation, and Overestimation of Depth-First Proof-Number Search",Akihiro Kishimoto,"Depth-first proof-number search (df-pn) is powerful AND/OR tree search to solve positions in games.  However, df-pn has a notorious problem of infinite loops when applied to domains with repetitions.  Df-pn(r) cures it by ignoring proof and disproof numbers that may lead to infinite loops.  This paper points out that df-pn(r) has a serious issue of underestimating proof and disproof numbers, while it also suffers from the overestimation problem  occurring in directed acyclic graph.  It then presents two practical solutions to these problems.  While bypassing infinite loops, the threshold controlling algorithm (TCA) solves the underestimation problem by increasing the thresholds of df-pn.  The source node detection algorithm (SNDA) detects the cause of overestimation and modifies the computation of proof and disproof numbers.  Both TCA and SNDA are implemented on top of df-pn to solve tsume-shogi (checkmating problem in Japanese chess).  Results show that df-pn with TCA and SNDA is far superior to df-pn(r).  Our tsume-shogi solver is able to solve several difficult positions previously unsolved by any other solvers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1567/1937,AND/OR tree search;df-pn;TCA;SNDA
18,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Searching Without a Heuristic: Efficient Use of Abstraction,"Bradford John Larsen, Ethan Burns, Wheeler Ruml, Robert Holte","In problem domains where an informative heuristic evaluation function is not known or not easily computed, abstraction can be used to derive admissible heuristic values.  Optimal path lengths in the abstracted problem are consistent heuristic estimates for the original problem.  Pattern databases are the traditional method of creating such heuristics, but they exhaustively compute costs for all abstract states and are thus usually appropriate only when all instances share the same single goal state.  Hierarchical heuristic search algorithms address these shortcomings by searching for paths in the abstract space on an as-needed basis.  However, existing hierarchical algorithms search less efficiently than pattern database constructors:  abstract nodes may be expanded many times during the course of a base-level search.  We present a novel hierarchical heuristic search algorithm, called Switchback, that uses an alternating direction of search to avoid abstract node re-expansions.  This algorithm is simple to implement and demonstrates superior performance to existing hierarchical heuristic search algorithms on several standard benchmarks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1893/1938,heuristic search; abstraction; pattern database; problem solving
19,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",A Stronger Consistency for Soft Global Constraints in Weighted Constraint Satisfaction,"Jimmy Lee, K. L. Leung","Weighted Constraint Satisfaction is made practical by powerful consistency techniques, such as AC*, FDAC* and EDAC*, which reduce search space effectively and efficiently during search, but they are designed for only binary and ternary constraints.  To allow soft global constraints, usually of high arity, to enjoy the same benefits, Lee and Leung give polynomial time algorithms to enforce generalized AC* (GAC*) and FDAC* (FDGAC*) for projection-safe soft non-binary constraints.  Generalizing the stronger EDAC* is less straightforward.  In this paper, we first reveal the oscillation problem when enforcing EDAC* on constraints sharing more than one variable.  To avoid oscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak EDGAC* for non-binary constraints.  Weak EDGAC* is stronger than FDGAC* and GAC*, but weaker than VAC and soft k-consistency for k > 2.  We also show that weak EDGAC* can be enforced in polynomial time for projection-safe constraints.  Extensive experimentation confirms the efficiency of our proposal.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1797/1939,WCSP; Global Constraints; Soft Constraints

In this paper we propose a new encoding from Maxclique into MaxSAT and use MaxSAT technology to improve the upper bound based on the partition P. In this way, the strength of specific algorithms for Maxclique in partitioning a graph and the strength of MaxSAT technology in propositional reasoning are naturally combined to solve Maxclique. Experimental results show that the approach is very effective on hard random graphs and on DIMACS Maxclique benchmarks, and allows to close an open DIMACS problem.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1611/1941,Branch-and-Bound; Maxclique; MaxSAT; Exact Algorithm for Maxclique

Sturtevant, Michael Buro, Timothy Furtak","Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search is a practical technique for playing imperfect information games that are too large to be optimally solved.  Although PIMC search has been criticized in the past for its theoretical deficiencies, in practice it has often produced strong results in a variety of domains.  In this paper, we set out to resolve this discrepancy.  The contributions of the paper are twofold.  First, we use synthetic game trees to identify game properties that result in strong or weak performance for PIMC search as compared to an optimal player.  Second, we show how these properties can be detected in real games, and demonstrate that they do indeed appear to be good predictors of the strength of PIMC search. Thus, using the tools established in this paper, it should be possible to decide a priori whether PIMC search will be an effective approach to new and unexplored games.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1876/1942,Games; TreeSearch; Planning
22,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Filtering Bounded Knapsack Constraints in Expected Sublinear Time,"Yuri Malitsky, Meinolf Sellmann, Radoslaw Szymanek",We present a highly efficient incremental algorithm for propagating bounded knapsack constraints. Our algorithm is based on the sublinear filtering algorithm for binary knapsack constraints by Katriel et al. and achieves similar speed-ups of one to two orders of magnitude when compared with its linear-time counterpart. We also show that the representation of bounded knapsacks as binary knapsacks leads to ineffective filtering behavior. Experiments on standard knapsack benchmarks show that the new algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for handling bounded knapsack constraints.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1855/1944,bounded knapsack; filtering
23,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Lazy Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning and Path Length Analysis in 3D,"Alex Nash, Sven Koenig, Craig Tovey","Grids with blocked and unblocked cells are often used to represent continuous 2D and 3D environments in robotics and video games. The shortest paths formed by the edges of 8-neighbor 2D grids can be up to 8% longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment. Theta* typically finds much shorter paths than that by propagating information along graph edges (to achieve short runtimes) without constraining paths to be formed by graph edges (to find short ""any-angle"" paths). We show in this paper that the shortest paths formed by the edges of 26-neighbor 3D grids can be 13% longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment, which highlights the need for smart path planning algorithms in 3D.  Theta* can be applied to 3D grids in a straight-forward manner, but it performs a line-of-sight check for each unexpanded visible neighbor of each expanded vertex and thus it performs many more line-of-sight checks per expanded vertex on a 26-neighbor 3D grid than on an 8-neighbor 2D grid. We therefore introduce Lazy Theta*, a variant of Theta* which uses lazy evaluation to perform only one line-of-sight check per expanded vertex (but with slightly more expanded vertices).  We show experimentally that Lazy Theta* finds paths faster than Theta* on 26-neighbor 3D grids, with one order of magnitude fewer line-of-sight checks and without an increase in path length.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1930/1945,"A*, Any-Angle Search, Grids, Path Planning, Heuristic Search, Robotics, Theta*, Video Games"

Search time can be significantly reduced if it is known which parts of the graph include ``swamps''---areas that cannot lie on the only available shortest path, and can thus safely be pruned during search.  We introduce an algorithm for detecting hierarchies of swamps, and exploiting them.

25,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Computing Cost-Optimal Definitely Discriminating Tests,"Anika Schumann, Jinbo Huang, Martin Sachenbacher","The goal of testing is to discriminate between multiple hypotheses about a system - for example, different fault diagnoses - by applying input patterns and verifying or falsifying the hypotheses from the observed outputs. Definitely discriminating tests (DDTs) are those input patterns that are guaranteed to discriminate between different hypotheses of non-deterministic systems. Finding DDTs is important in practice, but can be very expensive. Even more challenging is the problem of finding a DDT that minimizes the cost of the testing process, i.e., an input pattern that can be most cheaply enforced and that is a DDT. This paper addresses both problems. We show how we can transform a given problem into a Boolean structure in decomposable negation normal form (DNNF), and extract from it a Boolean formula whose models correspond to DDTs. This allows us to harness recent advances in both knowledge compilation and satisfiability for efficient and scalable DDT computation in practice. Furthermore, we show how we can generate a DNNF structure compactly encoding all DDTs of the problem and use it to obtain a cost-optimal DDT in time linear in the size of the structure. Experimental results from a real-world application show that our method can compute DDTs in less than 1 second for instances that were previously intractable, and cost-optimal DDTs in less than 20 seconds where previous approaches could not even compute an arbitrary DDT.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1564/1948,"Diagnosis, Model-based Reasoning, Constraints, Satisfiability"
26,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Latent Class Models for Algorithm Portfolio Methods,"Bryan Silverthorn, Risto Miikkulainen","Different solvers for computationally difficult problems such as satisfiability (SAT) perform best on different instances. Algorithm portfolios exploit this phenomenon by predicting solvers' performance on specific problem instances, then shifting computational resources to the solvers that appear best suited. This paper develops a new approach to the problem of making such performance predictions: natural generative models of solver behavior. Two are proposed, both following from an assumption that problem instances cluster into latent classes: a mixture of multinomial distributions, and a mixture of Dirichlet compound multinomial distributions. The latter model extends the former to capture burstiness, the tendency of solver outcomes to recur.  These models are integrated into an algorithm portfolio architecture and used to run standard SAT solvers on competition benchmarks. This approach is found competitive with the most prominent existing portfolio, SATzilla, which relies on domain-specific, hand-selected problem features; the latent class models, in contrast, use minimal domain knowledge. Their success suggests that these models can lead to more powerful and more general algorithm portfolio methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1781/1949,SAT; satisfiability; portfolio methods; latent class models

We present the first practical, admissible, and complete algorithm for solving problems of this kind. First, we propose a technique called operator decomposition, which can be used to reduce the branching factors of many search algorithms, including algorithms for cooperative pathfinding.  We then show how a type of independence common in instances of cooperative pathfinding problems can be exploited. Next, we take the idea of exploiting independent subproblems further by adding improvements that allow the algorithm to recognize many more cases of such independence. Finally, we show empirically that these techniques drastically improve the performance of the standard admissible algorithm for the cooperative pathfinding problem, and that their combination results in a complete algorithm capable of optimally solving relatively large problems in milliseconds.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1926/1950,Admissible; Heuristic Search; Cooperative Pathfinding; Multi-Agent Pathfinding; Multi-robot Pathfinding;

We apply a Bayesian model which combines collaborative filtering with a feature-based description of tasks and experts to yield a general framework for managing a portfolio of experts. The model learns an embedding of tasks and problems into a latent space in which affinity is measured by the inner product. The model can be trained incrementally and can track non-stationary data, tracking potentially changing expert and task characteristics. The approach allows us to use a principled decision theoretic framework for expert selection, allowing the user to choose a utility function that best suits their objectives. The model component for taking into account the performance feedback data is pluggable, allowing flexibility. We apply the model to manage a portfolio of algorithms to solve hard combinatorial problems.

We show that this continuum requires significantly less memory than BFS. In addition, a time speedup is also achieved when choosing the lookahead depth correctly.

However, when the TSPPD requires that the loading and unloading operations must be performed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner, we show that its feasible solutions can be represented by trees. Consequently, we develop a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) heuristic for the TSPPD with last-in-first-out loading (TSPPDL) involving several search operators based on the tree data structure. Experiments show that our VNS heuristic is superior to the current best heuristics for TSPPDL in terms of both solution quality and computing time.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1551/1956,
31,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Coalition Structure Generation based on Distributed Constraint Optimization,"Suguru Ueda, Atsushi Iwasaki, Makoto Yokoo, Marius Calin Silaghi, Katsutoshi Hirayama, Toshihiro Matsui","Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in AI and multi-agent systems (MAS). Coalition Structure generation (CSG) involves partitioning a set of agents into coalitions so that social surplus (the sum of the rewards of all coalitions) is maximized. A partition is called a Coalition Structure (CS). In traditional works, the value of a coalition is given by a black box function called a characteristic function. In this paper, we propose a novel formalization of CSG, i.e., we assume the value of a characteristic function is given by an optimal solution of a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) among the agents of a coalition. A DCOP is a popular approach for modeling cooperative agents, since it is quite general and can formalize various application problems in MAS. At first glance, one might assume that the computational costs required in this approach would be too expensive, since we need to solve an NP-hard problem just to obtain the value of a single coalition. To optimally solve a CSG, we might need to solve n-th power of 2 DCOP problem instances, where n is the number of agents. However, quite surprisingly, we show that an approximation algorithm, whose computational cost is about the same as solving just one DCOP, can find a CS with quality guarantees. More specifically, we develop an algorithm with parameter k that can find a CS whose social surplus is at least max(k/(w*+1), 2k/n) of the optimal CS, where w* is the tree width of a constraint graph. When k=1, the complexity of this algorithm is about the same as solving just one DCOP. These results illustrate that the locality of interactions among agents, which is explicitly modeled in the DCOP formalization, is quite useful in developing an efficient CSG algorithm with quality guarantees.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1809/1957,Coalition Structure Generation; Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem; Multi-agent System
32,2010,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",A Proof-Producing CSP Solver,"Michael Veksler, Ofer Strichman","PCS is a CSP solver that can produce a machine-checkable deductive proof in case it decides that the input problem is unsatisfiable. The roots of the proof may be nonclausal constraints, whereas the rest of the proof is based on resolution of signed clauses, ending with the empty clause. PCS uses parameterized, constraint-specific inference rules in order to bridge between the nonclausal and the clausal parts of the proof. The consequent of each such rule is a signed clause that is 1) logically implied by the nonclausal premise, and 2) strong enough to be the premise of the consecutive proof steps. The resolution process itself is integrated in the learning mechanism, and can be seen as a generalization to CSP of a similar solution that is adopted by competitive SAT solvers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1754/1959,csp;proof;cnf

Two influential methods aim to automate this process: automated algorithm configuration and portfolio-based algorithm selection. The former has the advantage of requiring virtually no domain knowledge, but produces only a single solver; the latter exploits per-instance variation, but requires a set of relatively uncorrelated candidate solvers. Here, we introduce Hydra, a novel technique for combining these two methods, thereby realizing the benefits of both. Hydra automatically builds a set of solvers with complementary strengths by iteratively configuring new algorithms. It is primarily intended for use in problem domains for which an adequate set of candidate solvers does not already exist. Nevertheless, we tested Hydra on a widely studied domain, stochastic local search algorithms for SAT, in order to characterize its performance against a well-established and highly competitive baseline. We found that Hydra consistently achieved major improvements over the best existing individual algorithms, and always at least roughly matched â and indeed often exceeded â the performance of the best portfolios of these algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1929/1960,automated algorithm design; portfolio-based algorithm selection; automated algorithm configuration; SAT; stochastic local search

As we know, previous algorithms for solving #SAT have been analyzed only regarding the number of variables as the parameter. However, the time complexity for solving #SAT instances depends not only on the number of variables, but also on the number of clauses. Therefore, it is significant to exploit the time complexity from the other point of view, i.e. the number of clauses. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving #2-SAT and #3-SAT with rigorous complexity analyses using the number of clauses as the parameter.

In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative ranking model to tackle two difficulties in analyzing clickthrough log. First, previous studies have shown that users tend to click top-ranked results even they are less relevant. Therefore, we use pairwise ranking relation to avoid the position bias in clicks. Second, since click data are extremely sparse with respect to each query or user, we construct a collaboration model to eliminate the sparseness problem. We also find that the proposed model and previous popular used click-based models address different aspects of clickthrough log data.

We observe that, while our target data are sparse for CF systems, related and relatively dense auxiliary data may already exist in some other more mature application domains. In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in a target domain by transferring knowledge about both users and items from auxiliary data sources. We observe that in different domains the user feedbacks are often heterogeneous such as ratings vs. clicks. Our solution is to integrate both user and item knowledge in auxiliary data sources through a principled matrix-based transfer learning framework that takes into account the data heterogeneity. In particular, we discover the principle coordinates of both users and items in the auxiliary data matrices, and transfer them to the target domain in order to reduce the effect of data sparsity. We describe our method, which is known as coordinate system transfer or CST, and demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering.

Zheng, Bin Cao, Yu Zheng, Xing Xie, Qiang Yang","With the increasing popularity of location tracking services such as GPS, more and more mobile data are being accumulated. Based on such data, a potentially useful service is to make timely and targeted recommendations for users on places where they might be interested to go and activities that they are likely to conduct. For example, a user arriving in Beijing might wonder where to visit and what she can do around the Forbidden City. A key challenge for such recommendation problems is that the data we have on each individual user might be very limited, while to make useful and accurate recommendations, we need extensive annotated location and activity information from user trace data. In this paper, we present a new approach, known as user-centered collaborative location and activity filtering (UCLAF), to pull many usersâ data together and apply collaborative filtering to find like-minded users and like-patterned activities at different locations. We model the userlocation- activity relations with a tensor representation, and propose a regularized tensor and matrix decomposition solution which can better address the sparse data problem in mobile information retrieval. We empirically evaluate UCLAF using a real-world GPS dataset collected from 164 users over 2.5 years, and showed that our system can outperform several state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1615/1964,collaborative filtering; mobile recommendation

Also, formalisms  proposed  so far are essentially propositional, which, at the very least, makes them  cumbersome to use in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose to  model  imperfect information games in a new multi-agent epistemic variant of the   situation calculus. By using the concept of only-knowing, the beliefs and  non-beliefs of players after any sequence of actions, sensing or otherwise,  can be characterized as entailments in this logic.

This allows us to formalize the construction of graphical models for utility functions, directed and undirected, and place them on the firm foundations of Pearl and Paz's axioms of semi-graphoids.

That approach has limited expressivity but results in orderings that capture interesting general preference principles. The second method consists of developing formalisms allowing the user to specify ""atomic"" improvements, and generating from them preferences on the powerset of the universe. We show that the particular formalism we propose is expressive enough to capture the lifted preference relations of the first approach, and generalizes propositional CP-nets.

In this paper, we present a first step towards a theoretical exploration of program debugging algorithms. The starting point of our work is the recent debugging approach based on predicate switching. The idea is to switch the outcome of an instance of a predicate to bring the program execution to a successful completion and then identify the fault by examining the switched predicate. However, no theoretical analysis of the approach is available. In this paper, we generalize the above idea, and propose the bounded debugging via multiple predicate switching (BMPS) algorithm, which locates faults through switching the outcomes of instances of multiple predicates to get a successful execution where each loop is executed for a bounded number of times. Clearly, BMPS can be implemented by resorting to a SAT solver. We focus attention on RHS faults, that is, faults that occur in the control predicates and right-hand-sides of assignment statements. We prove that for conditional programs, BMPS is quasi-complete for RHS faults in the sense that some part of any true diagnosis will be returned by BMPS; and for iterative programs, when the bound is sufficiently large, BMPS is also quasi-complete for RHS faults. Initial experimentation with debugging small C programs showed that BMPS can quickly and effectively locate the faults.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1739/1984,"Diagnosis and Abductive Reasoning; Action, Change, and Causality; Model-Based Reasoning"

In this paper, we propose a general epistemic revision framework where new evidence is of the form of a partial epistemic state. Our framework extends Jeffrey's rule with uncertain inputs and covers well-known existing frameworks such as ordinal conditional function (OCF) or possibility theory. We then define a set of postulates that such revision operators shall satisfy and establish representation theorems to characterize those postulates.

As probability theory is widely used to represent uncertainty, an interesting question therefore is whether it is possible to induce a probability distribution when merging belief sets. To this end, we first propose two approaches to inducing a probability distribution on a set of possible worlds, by extending the principle of indifference on possible worlds. We then study how the (in)dependence relations between atoms can influence the probability distribution. We also propose a set of properties to regulate the merging of belief sets when a probability distribution is output. Furthermore, our merging operators satisfy the well known Konieczny and Pino-Perez postulates if we use the set of possible worlds which have the maximal induced probability values.

Several attempts have been made to adapt classical model-based belief revision and update techniques to DLs, but they are restricted in several ways. In particular, they do not provide operators or algorithms for general DL KB revision. The key difficulty is that, unlike propositional logic, a DL KB may have infinitely many models with complex (and possibly infinite) structures, making it difficult to define and compute revisions in terms of models. In this paper, we study general KBs in a specific DL in the DL-Lite family. We introduce the concept of features for such KBs, develop an alternative semantic characterization of KBs using features (instead of models), define two specific revision operators for KBs, and present the first algorithm for computing best approximations for syntax-independent revisions of KBs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1786/1998,knowledge representation; description logic; revision; ontology
60,2010,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,Decidable Fragments of First-Order Language Under Stable Model Semantics and Circumscription,"Heng Zhang, Mingsheng Ying","The stable model semantics was recently generalized by Ferraris, Lee and Lifschitz to the full first-order language with a syntax translation approach that is very similar to McCarthy's circumscription. In this paper, we investigate the decidability and undecidability of various fragments of first-order language under both semantics of stable models and circumscription. Some maximally decidable classes and undecidable classes are identified. The results obtained in the paper show that the boundaries between decidability and undecidability for these two semantics are very different in spite of the similarity of definition. Moreover, for all fragments considered in the paper, decidability under the semantics of circumscription coincides with that in classical first-order logic. This seems rather counterintuitive due to the second-order definition of circumscription and the high undecidability of first-order circumscription.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1736/2000,Stable Model Semantics; Circumscription; Decidability; Satisfiability
61,2010,Machine Learning,Latent Variable Model for Learning in Pairwise Markov Networks,"Saeed Amizadeh, Milos Hauskrecht","Pairwise Markov Networks (PMN) are an important class of Markov networks which, due to their simplicity, are widely used in many applications such as image analysis, bioinformatics, sensor networks, etc. However, learning  of Markov networks from data is a challenging task; there are many possible structures one must consider and each of these structures comes with its own parameters making it easy to overfit the model with limited data. To deal with the problem, recent learning methods build upon the L1 regularization to express the bias towards sparse network structures. In this paper, we propose a new and more flexible framework that let us bias the structure, that can, for example, encode the preference to networks with certain local substructures which as a whole exhibit some  special global structure. We experiment with and show the benefit of our framework on two types of problems: learning of modular networks and learning of traffic networks models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1894/2001,Pairwise Markov Networks; L1-regularization; Variational Approximation; Structural Priors

In our setting, it is not practical to request samples ofÂ f(x) at precise input values due to the formidable cost of precise experimental setup. Rather, we may request a constrained experiment, which is a subset r of the input space for which the experimenter returnsÂ xÂ in r andÂ f(x). Importantly, as the constraints become looser, the experimental cost decreases, but the uncertainty about the locationÂ xÂ of the next observation increases. Our goal is to manage this trade-off by selecting a sequence of constrained experiments to best optimize f within the budget. We introduce cost-sensitive policies for selecting constrained experiments using both model-free and model-based approaches, inspired by policies for unconstrained settings. Experiments on synthetic functions and functions derived from real-world experimental data indicate that our policies outperform random selection, that the model-based policies are superior to model-free ones, and give insights into which policies are preferable overall.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1724/2002,"Bayesian Constraint Optimization, Budgeted Optimization, Gaussian Process"

We present a related but somewhat different task, assisted clustering, in which a user creates explicit groups of items from a large set and wants suggestions on what items to add to each group. While the traditional approach to interactive clustering has been to use metric learning to induce a distance metric, our situation seems equally amenable to classification. Using clusterings of documents from human subjects, we found that one or the other method proved to be superior for a given cluster, but not uniformly so. We thus developed a hybrid mechanism for combining the metric learner and the classifier.

The reported results suggest that cross-domain transfer is beneficial in the scenarios that we investigated, lending further evidence that this strategy is a broadly effective means for increasing the efficiency of learning systems.

65,2010,Machine Learning,Adaptive Transfer Learning,"Bin Cao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Yu Zhang, Dit-Yan Yeung, Qiang Yang","Transfer learning aims at reusing the knowledge in some source tasks to improve the learning of a target task. Many transfer learning methods assume that the source tasks and the target task be related, even though many tasks are not related in reality. However, when two tasks are unrelated, the knowledge extracted from a source task may not help, and even hurt, the performance of a target task. Thus, how to avoid negative transfer and then ensure a ""safe transfer"" of knowledge is crucial in transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Transfer learning algorithm based on Gaussian Processes (AT-GP), which can be used to adapt the transfer learning schemes by automatically estimating the similarity between a source and a target task. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new semi-parametric transfer kernel for transfer learning from a Bayesian perspective, and propose to learn the model with respect to the target task, rather than all tasks as in multi-task learning. We can formulate the transfer learning problem as a unified Gaussian Process (GP) model.

To reduce the labeling cost, active learning attempts to discover the most informative data points for labeling. Recently, Optimal Experimental Design (OED) techniques have attracted an increasing amount of attention. OED is concerned with the design of experiments that minimizes variances of a parameterized model. Typical design criteria include D-, A-, and E-optimality. However, all these criteria are based on an ordinary linear regression model which aims to minimize the empirical error whereas the geometrical structure of the data space is not well respected. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal experimental design approach for active learning, called Laplacian G-Optimal Design (LapGOD), which considers both discriminating and geometrical structures. By using Laplacian Regularized Least Squares which incorporates manifold regularization into linear regression, our proposed algorithm selects those data points that minimizes the maximum variance of the predicted values on the data manifold. We also extend our algorithm to nonlinear case by using kernel trick. The experimental results on various image databases have shown that our proposed LapGOD active learning algorithm can significantly enhance the classification accuracy if the selected data points are used as training data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1741/2009,Active Learning;Classification;Kernel Methods

In this setting, the learning system is dealing with samples and labels provided by multiple teachers, who in common cases, are non-expert. Their labeling styles and behaviors are usually diverse, some of which are even detrimental to the learning system. Thus, simply putting them together and utilizing the algorithms designed for single-teacher scenario would be not only improper, but also damaging. The problem calls for more specific methods. Our work focuses on a case where the teachers are composed of good ones and irresponsible ones. By irresponsible, we mean the teacher who takes the labeling task not seriously and label the sample at random without inspecting the sample itself. This behavior is quite common when the task is not attractive enough and the teacher just wants to finish it as soon as possible. Sometimes, the irresponsible teachers could take a considerable part among all the teachers. If we do not take out their effects, our learning system would be ruined with no doubt. In this paper, we propose a method for picking out the good teachers with promising experimental results.

Inspired by this observation, in this paper, instead of considering each face image as an example with one label (age), we regard each face image as an example associated with a label distribution. The label distribution covers a number of class labels, representing the degree that each label describes the example. Through this way, in addition to the real age, one face image can also contribute to the learning of its adjacent ages.

In the BPT model a document is modeled as a distribution over topics that is a mixture of the distributions associated with the related documents. Although BPT aims at obtaining a better document modeling by incorporating the relations among the documents, it could also be applied to many applications including detecting the topics from corpora and clustering the documents.

In the second stage, based on the learnt metric, the large-scale dataset is firstly filtered into a small set according to the nearest neighbor criterion. Then a sparse representation is computed by the non-negative least squares technique. The sparse solution is unique and can be optimized efficiently. The extensive numerical experiments on several public databases demonstrate that the proposed TSR approach generally obtains better classification accuracy than the state of the art Sparse Representation Classification (SRC).

Many of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for learning MLNs have focused on relatively small datasets with few descriptive attributes, where predicates are mostly binary and the main task is usually prediction of links between entities. This paper addresses what is in a sense a complementary problem: learning the structure of an MLN that models the distribution of discrete descriptive attributes on medium to large datasets, given the links between entities in a relational database. Descriptive attributes are usually nonbinary and can be very informative, but they increase the search space of possible candidate clauses. We present an efficient new algorithm for learning a directed relational model (parametrized Bayes net), which produces an MLN structure via a standard moralization procedure for converting directed models to undirected models.

Also, the acquisition of labeled data requires medical diagnosis which is expensive, while the collection of unlabeled data such as basic health information is much cheaper. We propose the CS4VM (Cost-Sensitive Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine) to address this problem.

Multi-Instance Dimensionality Reduction by Learning a Maximum Bag Margin Subspace,"Wei Ping, Ye Xu, Kexin Ren, Chi-Hung Chi, Furao Shen","Multi-instance learning, as other machine learning tasks, also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although dimensionality reduction methods have been investigated for many years, multi-instance dimensionality reduction methods remain untouched. On the other hand, most algorithms in multi- instance framework treat instances in each bag as independently and identically distributed samples, which fails to utilize the structure information conveyed by instances in a bag. In this paper, we propose a multi-instance dimensionality reduction method, which treats instances in each bag as non-i.i.d. samples. We regard every bag as a whole entity and define a bag margin objective function. By maximizing the margin of positive and negative bags, we learn a subspace to obtain more salient representation of original data.

89,2010,Machine Learning,Conformal Mapping by Computationally Efficient Methods,"Stefan Pintilie, Ali Ghodsi","Dimensionality reduction is the process by which a set of data points in a higher dimensional space are mapped to a lower dimension while maintaining certain properties of these points relative to each other. One important property is the preservation of the three angles formed by a triangle consisting of three neighboring points in the high dimensional space. If this property is maintained for those same points in the lower dimensional embedding then the result is a conformal map. However, many of the commonly used nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) or Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEM), do not produce conformal maps. Post-processing techniques formulated as instances of semi-definite programming (SDP) problems can be applied to the output of either LLE or LEM to produce a conformal map. However, the effectiveness of this approach is limited by the computational complexity of SDP solvers. This paper will propose an alternative post-processing algorithm that produces a conformal map but does not require a solution to a SDP problem and so is more computationally efficient thus allowing it to be applied to a wider selection of datasets. Using this alternative solution, the paper will also propose a new algorithm for 3D object classification. An interesting feature of the 3D classification algorithm is that it is invariant to the scale and the orientation of the surface.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1779/2037,Data Mining; Classification; Machine Learning; Unsupervised Learning

In collaborative filtering and many other tasks, the objective is to fill in missing elements of a sparse data matrix. One of the biggest challenges in this case is filling in a column or row of the matrix with very few observations. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian matrix factorization model that performs regression against side information known about the data in addition to the observations. The side information helps by adding observed entries to the factored matrices.  We also introduce a nonparametric mixture model for the prior of the rows and columns of the factored matrices that gives a different regularization for each latent class. Besides providing a richer prior, the posterior distribution of mixture assignments reveals the latent classes. Using Gibbs sampling for inference, we apply our model to the Netflix Prize problem of predicting movie ratings given an incomplete user-movie ratings matrix.  Incorporating rating information with gathered metadata information, our Bayesian approach outperforms other matrix factorization techniques even when using fewer dimensions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1871/2039,Matrix Factorization; Bayesian; Collaborative Filtering;

It approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two nonnegative matrices. In many applications with data such as human faces or digits, data often reside on multiple manifolds, which may overlap or intersect. But the traditional NMF method and  other existing variants of NMF do not consider this. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm that explicitly models the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data on multiple manifolds with NMF.

In single-instance learning problems, dimensionality reduction is an essential step for high-dimensional data analysis and has been studied for years. The curse of dimensionality also exists in multiinstance learning tasks, yet this difficult task has not been studied before. Direct application of existing single-instance dimensionality reduction objectives to multi-instance learning tasks may not work well since it ignores the characteristic of multi-instance learning that the labels of bags are known while the labels of instances are unknown. In this paper, we propose an effective model and develop an efficient algorithm to solve the multi-instance dimensionality reduction problem. We formulate the objective as an optimization problem by considering orthonormality and sparsity constraints in the projection matrix for dimensionality reduction, and then solve it by the gradient descent along the tangent space of the orthonormal matrices.

In many applications, however, to get the full label set for each instance is difficult and only a âpartialâ set of labels is available. In such cases, the appearance of a label means that the instance is associated with this label, while the absence of a label does not imply that this label is not proper for the instance. We call this kind of problem âweak labelâ problem. In this paper, we propose the WELL (WEak Label Learning) method to solve the weak label problem. We consider that the classification boundary for each label should go across low density regions, and that each label generally has much smaller number of positive examples than negative examples. The objective is formulated as a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently. Moreover, we exploit the correlation between labels by assuming that there is a group of low-rank base similarities, and the appropriate similarities between instances for different labels can be derived from these base similarities.

Compared with the well-known Hough transform (HT) method, the ACS-based curve extraction approach can deal with both regular and irregular curves without knowing their shapes in advance. The proposed approach has many characteristics such as faster convergence, implicit parallelism and strong ability to deal with highly-noised images.

We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent.

Unfortunately, these algorithms all require access to a planner that computes a near optimal policy, and while many traditional MDP algorithms make this guarantee, their computation time grows with the number of states. We show how to replace these over-matched planners with a class of sample-based planners â whose computation time is independent of the number of states â without sacrificing the sample-efficiency guarantees of the overall learning algorithms.  To do so, we define sufficient criteria for a sample-based planner to be used in such a learning system and analyze two popular sample-based approaches from the literature.  We also introduce our own sample-based planner, which combines the strategies from these algorithms and still meets the criteria for integration into our learning system. In doing so, we define the first complete RL solution for compactly represented (exponentially sized) state spaces with efficiently learnable dynamics that is both sample efficient and whose computation time does not grow rapidly with the number of states.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1880/2049,reinforcement learning; sample-based planning; markov decision process

Although both attributes and pairwise similarities are useful for class membership inference, many traditional embedding algorithms only deal with one type of input data. In order to make use of the both types of data simultaneously, in this work, we propose a novel Discriminant Laplacian Embedding (DLE) approach. Supervision information from training data are integrated into DLE to improve the discriminativity of the resulted embedding space. By solving the ambiguity problem in computing the scatter matrices caused by data points with multiple labels, we successfully extend the proposed DLE to multi-label classification. In addition, through incorporating the label correlations, the classification performance using multi-label DLE is further enhanced.

Most MKL methods employ the L1-norm simplex constraints on the combination weights of kernels, which therefore involves optimization of a non-smooth function of the kernel weights. These methods usually divide the optimization into two cycles: one cycle deals with the optimization on the kernel combination weights, and the other cycle updates the parameters of SVM. Despite the success of their efficiency, they tend to discard informative complementary kernels. To improve accuracy, we introduce smoothness to the optimization procedure.

A notable advantage of LSIR over existing approaches is that  tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation, allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion.

Intuitively, with task outputs coupled by constraints, active learning can utilize not only the uncertainty of the prediction in a single task but also the inconsistency of predictions across tasks. We formalize this idea as a cross-task value of information criteria, in which the reward of a labeling assignment is propagated and measured over all relevant tasks reachable through constraints. A specific example of our framework leads to the cross entropy measure on the predictions of coupled tasks, which generalizes the entropy in the classical single-task uncertain sampling.

Since redundant features can have significant adverse effect on learning performance, it is necessary to address this limitation for spectral feature selection. To this end, we propose a novel spectral feature selection algorithm to handle feature redundancy, adopting an embedded model. The algorithm is derived from a formulation based on a sparse multi-output regression with a L2,1-norm constraint.

118,2010,Multiagent Systems,Approximation Algorithms and Mechanism Design for Minimax Approval Voting,"Ioannis Caragiannis, Dimitris Kalaitzis, Evangelos Markakis","We consider approval voting elections in which each voter votes for a (possibly empty) set of candidates and the outcome consists of a set of k candidates for some parameter k, e.g., committee elections. We are interested in the minimax approval voting rule in which the outcome represents a compromise among the voters, in the sense that the maximum distance between the preference of any voter and the outcome is as small as possible. This voting rule has two main drawbacks. First, computing an outcome that minimizes the maximum distance is computationally hard. Furthermore, any algorithm that always returns such an outcome provides incentives to voters to misreport their true preferences.  In order to circumvent these drawbacks, we consider approximation algorithms, i.e., algorithms that produce an outcome that approximates the minimax distance for any given instance. Such algorithms can be considered as alternative voting rules. We present a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm that uses a natural linear programming relaxation for the underlying optimization problem and deterministically rounds the fractional solution in order to compute the outcome; this result improves upon the previously best known algorithm that has an approximation ratio of 3. We are furthermore interested in approximation algorithms that are resistant to manipulation by (coalitions of) voters, i.e., algorithms that do not motivate voters to misreport their true preferences in order to improve their distance from the outcome. We complement previous results in the literature with new upper and lower bounds on strategyproof and group-strategyproof algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1717/2078,
119,2010,Multiagent Systems,Voting Almost Maximizes Social Welfare Despite Limited Communication,"Ioannis Caragiannis, Ariel D. Procaccia","In cooperative multiagent systems an alternative that maximizes the social welfare â the sum of utilities â can only be selected if each agent reports its full utility function. This may be infeasible in environments where communication is restricted. Employing a voting rule to choose an alternative greatly reduces the communication burden, but leads to a possible gap between the social welfare of the optimal alternative and the social welfare of the one that is ultimately elected. Procaccia and Rosenschein have introduced the concept of distortion to quantify this gap.  In this paper, we present the notion of embeddings into voting rules: functions that receive an agent's utility function and return the agent's vote. We establish that very low distortion can be obtained using randomized embeddings, especially when the number of agents is large compared to the number of alternatives. We investigate our ideas in the context of three prominent voting rules with low communication costs: Plurality, Approval, and Veto. Our results arguably provide a compelling reason for employing voting in cooperative multiagent systems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1762/2079,Social choice

Our algorithm, called Valued Nash Propagation (VNP), integrates the optimisation problem of maximising a criterion with the constraint satisfaction problem of finding a game's equilibria to construct a criterion that defines a c-semiring.  Given a suitably compact game structure, this criterion can be efficiently optimised using message-passing.  To this end, we first show that VNP is complete in games whose interaction structure forms a hypertree.  Then, we go on to provide theoretic and empirical results justifying its use on games with arbitrary structure; in particular, we show that it computes the optimum >82% of the time and otherwise selects an equilibrium that is always within 2% of the optimum on average.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1694/2082,"Game theory, distributed optimisation"

The former views voting as an attempt to reconstruct the correct ordering of the candidates given noisy estimates (i.e., votes), while the latter explains voting as search for the nearest consensus outcome. We provide conditions under which an MLE interpretation of a voting rule coincides with its DR interpretation, and classify a number of classic voting rules, such as Kemeny, Plurality, Borda and Single Transferable Vote (STV), according to how well they fit each of these frameworks. The classification we obtain is more precise than the ones that result from using MLE or DR alone: indeed, we show that the MLE approach can be used to guide our search for a more refined notion of distance rationalizability and vice versa.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1651/2087,voting; distance rationalizability; maximum likelihood estimation; Kemeny; STV; plurality; Borda

The question then arises whether or not a given aggregation procedure will lift the rationality assumptions from the individual to the collective level, i.e., whether the collective choice will be rational whenever all individual choices are.

Work on intentions in multi-agent systems has focused on   joint intention models, which characterise the mental state of   agents with a shared goal engaged in teamwork. In the absence of   shared goals, however, intentions play another crucial role in   multi-agent activity: they provide a basis around which agents can   mutually coordinate activities. Models based on shared goals do not   attempt to account for or explain this role of intentions. In this   paper, we present a formal model of multi-agent systems in which   belief-desire-intention agents choose their intentions taking into   account the intentions of others.

In just a single run, the auction is able to extract enough value information from bidders to compute approximate truth-inducing payments. This stands in contrast to current auction designs that need to repeat the allocation computation as many times as there are bidders to achieve incentive compatibility. The auction is formulated as a kernel method, which allows for flexibility in choosing the price structure via a kernel function. Our main result characterizes the extent to which our auction is incentive-compatible in terms of the complexity of the chosen kernel function.

It compared the performance between automatic negotiators that interacted with PDAs to automatic negotiators that interacted with actual people in different domains. The experiments included more than 300 human subjects and 50 PDAs developed by students. Results showed that the automatic negotiators outperformed PDAs in the same situations in which they outperformed  people, and that on average, they exhibited the same measure of generosity towards their negotiation partners. These patterns were significant for all types of domains, and for all types of automated negotiators, despite the fact that there were individual differences between the behavior of PDAs and people.

In such situations, agents' individual preferences over available alternatives may vary, and they may try to reconcile these differences by voting. Based on the fact that agents may have incentives to vote strategically and misreport their real preferences, a number of recent papers have explored different possibilities for avoiding or eliminating such manipulations. In contrast to most prior work, this paper focuses on convergence of strategic behavior to a decision from which no voter will want to deviate.  We consider scenarios where voters cannot coordinate their actions, but are allowed to change their vote after observing the current outcome. We focus on the Plurality voting rule, and study the conditions under which this iterative game is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium (i.e., to a decision that is stable against further unilateral manipulations).  We show for the first time how convergence depends on the exact attributes of the game, such as the tie-breaking scheme, and on assumptions regarding agents' weights and strategies.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1770/2097,"social choice, voting, plurality, equilibrium, convergence"

135,2010,Multiagent Systems,Trust Models and Con-Man Agents: From Mathematical to Empirical Analysis,"Amirali Salehi-Abari, Tony White","Recent work has demonstrated that several trust and reputation models can be exploited by malicious agents with cyclical behaviour. In each cycle, the malicious agent with cyclical behaviour first regains a high trust value after a number of cooperations and then abuses its gained trust by engaging in a bad transaction. Using a game theoretic formulation, Salehi-Abari and White have proposed the AER model that is resistant to exploitation by cyclical behaviour. Their simulation results imply that FIRE, Regret, and a model due to Yu and Singh, can always be exploited with an appropriate value for the period of cyclical behaviour. Furthermore, their results demonstrate that this is not so for the proposed adaptive scheme. This paper provides a mathematical analysis of the properties of five trust models when faced with cyclical behaviour of malicious agents. Three main results are proven. First, malicious agents can always select a cycle period that allows them to exploit the four models of FIRE, Regret, Probabilistic models, and  Yu and Singh indefinitely. Second, malicious agents cannot select a single, finite cycle period that allows them to exploit the AER model forever. Finally,  the number of cooperations required to achieve a given trust value increases monotonically with each cycle.  In addition to the mathematical analysis, this paper empirically shows how malicious agents can use the theorems proven in this paper to mount efficient attacks on trust models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1598/2102,Trust Models; Exploitation; Mathematical Analysis; Con-man Agent; Vulnerability; Attack

In particular, it considers the case where the searching agent incurs a cost for learning the value of an agent and the goal is to minimize the expected overall cost of search by iteratively increasing the extent of search.  This kind of search is applicable to various domains, including auctions, first responders, and sensor networks.  Using an innovative transformation of the extents-based sequence to a probability-based one, the optimal sequence is proved to consist of either a single search iteration or an infinite sequence of increasing search extents.  This leads to a simplified characterization of the the optimal search sequence from which it can be derived.  This method is also highly useful for legacy economic-search applications, where all agents are considered suitable candidates and the goal is to optimize the search process as a whole.

In characteristic function games (CFGs), each coalition C of agents is assigned a value indicating the joint utility those agents will receive if C is formed. CFGs are an important class of cooperative games; however, determining the optimal coalition structure, partitioning of the agents into a set of coalitions that maximizes the social welfare, currently requires O(3n) time for n agents. In light of the high computational complexity of the coalition structure generation problem, a natural approach is to relax the optimality requirement and attempt to find an approximate solution that is guaranteed to be close to optimal. Unfortunately, it has been shown that guaranteeing a solution within any factor of the optimal requires Î©(2n) time. Thus, the best that can be hoped for is to find an algorithm that returns solutions that are guaranteed to be as close to the optimal as possible, in as close to O(2n) time as possible. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by presenting an algorithm that achieves better quality guarantees with lower worst case running times than all currently existing algorithms.

139,2010,Multiagent Systems,Asymmetric Spite in Auctions,"Ankit Sharma, Tuomas Sandholm","In many auctions, agents bid more aggressively than self-interest would prescribe. This can be explained by spite, where the agent's utility not only increases in the agent's surplus but also decreases as the other bidders' surpluses increase. Spite can stem from long-term benefits from making competitors worse off and from inherent psychological effects. There have been important recent game-theoretic analyses of spiteful bidding assuming all agents are equally spiteful. We present, to our knowledge, the first auction analysis in the more realistic setting where bidders may be spiteful to different extents. We show that the equilibrium bidding function can still be written in the same form â except that the spite factor is replaced by an expressed spite factor. This leads to bidders expressing spites that are higher or lower than their true spite depending on others' spite. Perhaps surprisingly, in the two-bidder case, the mapping from true spite to expressed spite is the same across all common auction mechanisms. Furthermore, even with two bidders, important properties of symmetric-spite settings cease to hold: the allocation can be inefficient and the revenue ranking may reverse between first- and second-price auctions. We also show that in sealed-bid auctions under asymmetric valuation distributions, there can be a ""bargaining problem"" in selecting bids. Finally, we study the generalization where agents can have different extents of spite toward different other bidders.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1728/2109,"Auctions and Market-Based Systems, Game Theory, E-Commerce"

These sensors can be deployed in unknown and possibly hostile environments, where uncertainty and dynamism are endemic. Such environments are common in the areas of disaster response and military surveillance. Our coordination approach itself is based on work by Stranders et al. (2009), that uses the max-sum algorithm to coordinate mobile sensors for monitoring spatial phenomena. In particular, we generalise and extend their approach to any domain where measurements can be valued. Also, we introduce a clustering approach that allows sensors to negotiate over paths to the most relevant locations, as opposed to a set of ï¬xed directions, which results in a signiï¬cantly improved performance. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to two challenging and distinct information gathering tasks. In the ï¬rstâpursuit-evasion (PE)âsensors need to capture a target whose movement might be unknown. In the secondâpatrolling (P)âsensors need to minimise loss from intrusions that occur within their environment.

While the optimal allocation of inventory can provide greater efficiency and revenue, natural formulations of the underlying optimization problems grow exponentially in the number of features of interest, presenting a key practical challenge.  To address this problem, we propose a means for automatically partitioning inventory into abstract channels so that the least relevant features are ignored.  Our approach, based on LP/MIP column and constraint generation, dramatically reduces the size of the problem, thus rendering optimization computationally feasible at practical scales.

146,2010,Multiagent Systems,Compilation Complexity of Common Voting Rules,"Lirong Xia, Vincent Conitzer","In computational social choice, one important problem is to take the votes of a subelectorate (subset of the voters), and summarize them using a small number of bits. This needs to be done in such a way that, if all that we know is the summary, as well as the votes of voters outside the subelectorate, we can conclude which of the m alternatives wins. This corresponds to the notion of compilation complexity, the minimum number of bits required to summarize the votes for a particular rule, which was introduced by Chevaleyre et al. [IJCAI-09]. We study three different types of compilation complexity. The first, studied by Chevaleyre et al., depends on the size of the subelectorate but not on the size of the complement (the voters outside the subelectorate). The second depends on the size of the complement but not on the size of the subelectorate. The third depends on both.  We first investigate the relations among the three types of compilation complexity. Then, we give upper and lower bounds on all three types of compilation complexity for the most prominent voting rules. We show that for l-approval (when l â¤ m/2), Borda, and Bucklin, the bounds for all three types are asymptotically tight, up to a multiplicative constant; for l-approval (when l > m/2), plurality with runoff, all Condorcet consistent rules that are based on unweighted majority graphs (including Copeland and voting trees), and all Condorcet consistent rules that are based on the order of pairwise elections (including ranked pairs and maximin), the bounds for all three types are asymptotically tight up to a multiplicative constant when the sizes of the subelectorate and its complement are both larger than m1+Îµ for some Îµ > 0.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1789/2118,

This can be modeled as an extensive-form game of perfect information, which we call a Stackelberg voting game.  We first propose a dynamic-programming algorithm for finding the backward-induction outcome for any Stackelberg voting game when the rule is anonymous; this algorithm is efficient if the number of alternatives is no more than a constant. We show how to use compilation functions to further reduce the time and space requirements.  Our main theoretical results are paradoxes for the backward-induction outcomes of Stackelberg voting games. We show that for any n â¥ 5 and any voting rule that satisfies nonimposition and with a low domination index, there exists a profile consisting of n voters, such that the backward-induction outcome is ranked somewhere in the bottom two positions in almost every voterâs preferences. Moreover, this outcome loses all but one of its pairwise elections. Furthermore, we show that many common voting rules have a very low (= 1) domination index, including all majority-consistent voting rules. For the plurality and nomination rules, we show even stronger paradoxes.  Finally, using our dynamic-programming algorithm, we run simulations to compare the backward-induction outcome of the Stackelberg voting game to the winner when voters vote truthfully, for the plurality and veto rules. Surprisingly, our experimental results suggest that on average, more voters prefer the backward-induction outcome.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1788/2119,Stackelberg voting game; dynamic-programming; paradoxes

We prove that this augmentation results in a stronger notion of convergence than the basic gradient ascent, that is, strategies converge to a Nash equilibrium within a restricted class of iterated games. Motivated by this augmentation, we then propose a new practical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm exploiting approximate policy prediction.

We propose a new auction-like algorithm, called Sequential Incremental-Value (SIV) auction, which assigns tasks to robots in multiple rounds. The idea behind SIV auctions is to assign as many tasks per round to robots as possible as long as their individual costs for performing these tasks are at most a given bound, which increases exponentially from round to round.

We introduce the scoring-rule (SR) mechanism, which biases in favor of allocating items that an agent values above the population consensus. The SR mechanism is not strategyproof but has tolerable manipulability in the sense that: (i) if every agent optimally manipulates, it reduces to APSD, and (ii) it significantly outperforms APSD for rank efficiency when only a fraction of agents are strategic.

One of the main challenges such agents face is to automatically learn knowledge-based heuristics in real-time, whether for evaluating game positions or for search guidance.  In recent years, GGP agents that use Monte-Carlo simulations to reason about their actions have become increasingly more popular.  For competitive play such an approach requires an effective search-control mechanism for guiding the simulation playouts.   In here we introduce several schemes for automatically learning search guidance based on both statistical and reinforcement learning techniques.   We compare the different schemes empirically on a variety of games  and show that they improve significantly upon the current state-of-the-art in simulation-control in GGP.  For example, in the chess-like game Skirmish, which has proved a particularly challenging game for simulation-based GGP agents,  an agent employing one of the proposed schemes achieves 97% winning rate against an unmodified agent.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1892/2124,general game playing; search; machine learning
153,2010,Multidisciplinary Topics,User-Specific Learning for Recognizing a Singer's Intended Pitch,"Andrew Guillory, Sumit Basu, Dan Morris","We consider the problem of automatic vocal melody transcription: translating an audio recording of a sung melody into a musical score.  While previous work has focused on finding the closest notes to the singer's tracked pitch, we instead seek to recover the melody the singer intended to sing.  Often, the melody a singer intended to sing differs from what they actually sang; our hypothesis is that this occurs in a singer-specific way.  For example, a given singer may often be flat in certain parts of her range, or another may have difficulty with certain intervals.  We thus pursue methods for singer-specific training which use learning to combine different methods for pitch prediction.  In our experiments with human subjects, we show that via a short training procedure we can learn a singer-specific pitch predictor and significantly improve transcription of intended pitch over other methods.  For an average user, our method gives a 20 to 30 percent reduction in pitch classification errors with respect to a baseline method which is comparable to commercial voice transcription tools.  For some users, we achieve even more dramatic reductions.  Our best results come from a combination of singer-specific-learning with non-singer-specific feature selection.  We also discuss the implications of our work for training more general control signals.

154,2010,Multidisciplinary Topics,A Computational Model for Saliency Maps by Using Local Entropy,"Yuewei Lin, Bin Fang, Yuanyan Tang","This paper presents a computational framework for saliency maps. It employs the Earth Mover's Distance based on weighted-Histogram (EMD-wH) to measure the center-surround difference, instead of the Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) filter used by traditional models. In addition, the model employs not only the traditional features such as colors, intensity and orientation but also the local entropy which expresses the local complexity. The major advantage of combining the local entropy map is that it can detect the salient regions which are not complex regions. Also, it uses a general framework to integrate the feature dimensions instead of summing the features directly. This model considers both local and global salient information, in contrast to the existing models that consider only one or the other. Furthermore, the ""large scale bias"" and ""central bias"" hypotheses are used in this model to select the fixation locations in the saliency map of different scales. The performance of this model is assessed by comparing their saliency maps and human fixation density.

The first step facilitates clustering by naturally separating the strokes, and both steps fluidly integrate spatial and temporal information. Our approach to grouping is unique in its formulation as an efficient classification task rather than, for example, an expensive search task. Our single-stroke classifier performs at least as well as existing single-stroke classifiers on text vs. nontext classification, and we present the first three-way single-stroke classification results.

In this paper, we address the fundamental limitation of existing GDL to be confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state. To this end, we develop an extension of GDL that is both simple and elegant yet expressive enough to allow to formalise the rules of arbitrary (discrete and finite) n-player games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge.

Firstly, by matching the extracted emoticons to a raw emoticon database, containing over ten thousand emoticon samples extracted from the Web and annotated automatically. The emoticons for which emotion types could not be determined using only this database, are automatically divided into semantic areas representing ""mouths"" or ""eyes,"" based on the theory of kinesics. The areas are automatically annotated according to their co-occurrence in the database.

It has important applications in analyzing data from automated monitoring, surveillance, and intelligence analysis in general. In this paper, we formalize MAPR using a basic model that explicates the cost of abduction in single agent plan recognition by ""flattening"" or decompressing the (usually compact, hierarchical) plan library. We show that single-agent plan recognition with a decompressed library can be solved in time polynomial in the input size, while it is known that with a compressed (by partial ordering constraints) library it is NP-complete. This leads to an important insight: that although the compactness of the plan library plays an important role in the hardness of single-agent plan recognition (as recognized in the existing literature), that is not the case with multiple agents. We show, for the first time, that MAPR is NP-complete even when the (multi-agent) plan library is fully decompressed. As with previous solution approaches, we break the problem into two stages: hypothesis generation and hypothesis search. We show that Knuth's ``Algorithm X'' (with the efficient ``dancing links'' representation) is particularly suited for our model, and can be adapted to perform a branch and bound search for the second stage, in this model.

We present a novel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for optimal search, while maintaining its benefits.

That model describes the behavior of Business Objects, in terms of status variables and how they are affected by system transactions. We show herein that one can leverage the model to obtain (a) a promising BPM planning application which incurs hardly any modeling costs, and (b) an interesting planning benchmark. We design a suitable planning formalism and an adaptation of FF, and we perform large-scale experiments.

Ong","The behavior of a complex system often depends on parameters whose values are unknown in advance. To operate effectively, an autonomous agent must actively gather information on the parameter values while progressing towards its goal. We call this problem parameter elicitation. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a principled framework for such uncertainty planning tasks, but they suffer from high computational complexity. However, POMDPs for parameter elicitation often possess special structural properties, specifically, factorization and symmetry. This work identifies these properties and exploits them for efficient solution through a factored belief representation. The experimental results show that our new POMDP solvers outperform SARSOP and MOMDP, two of the fastest general-purpose POMDP solvers available, and can handle significantly larger problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1798/2156,"POMDPs; Planning under Uncertainty; Sequential Decision Making; Reasoning under Uncertainty; Reasoning about Plans, Processes and Actions"

Implicit dead ends, states with executable actions but no path to the goal, are particularly challenging; existing MDP solvers spend much time and memory identifying these states.  As a first attempt to address this issue, we propose a machine learning algorithm called SIXTHSENSE. SIXTHSENSE helps existing MDP solvers by finding nogoods, conjunctions of literals whose truth in a state implies that the state is a dead end. Importantly, our learned nogoods are sound, and hence the states they identify are true dead ends. SIXTHSENSE is very fast, needs little training data, and takes only a small fraction of total planning time. While IPPC problems may have millions of dead ends, they may typically be represented with only a dozen or two no-goods. Thus, nogood learning efficiently produces a quick and reliable means for dead-end recognition. Our experiments show that the nogoods found by SIXTHSENSE routinely reduce planning space and time on IPPC domains, enabling some planners to solve problems they could not previously handle.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1925/2158,MDP; dead ends; planning under uncertainty

We use a wait action to instruct this planner to consider continuous effects in a given state. We also introduce a new planning domain to demonstrate the benefits of planning with nonlinear continuous effects. We compare our approach with a linear continuous effects planner and a discrete effects HTN planner on a benchmark domain, which reveals that its additional costs are largely mitigated by domain knowledge.

Recently, it has been shown that this problem can be  solved  efficiently, without the need of a plan library, using slightly modified planning algorithms. In this work, we extend this approach to the  more general problem of probabilistic plan recognition where a probability distribution over the set of goals is sought under the assumptions that actions have deterministic effects and both agent and observer have complete information about the initial state. We show that this problem can  be  solved efficiently using classical planners provided that the probability of a partially observed execution given a goal is defined in terms of the cost difference of achieving the goal under two conditions: complying  with the observations, and  not complying with them. This cost, and hence the posterior goal probabilities,  are computed  by means of two calls to a classical planner that no longer has to be modified in any way.

Drawing parallels to POMDP value functions, we devise a Witness-style algorithm for identifying nondominated policies.

Given noisy real-world GPS data, we---in contrast---consider the problem of modeling and recognizing activities that involve multiple related individuals playing a variety of roles.  Our test domain is the game of capture the flag---an outdoor game that involves many distinct cooperative and competitive joint activities.  We model the domain using Markov logic, a statistical relational language, and learn a theory that jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such as capturing a player. Our model combines constraints imposed by the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the rules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound fashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a multi-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it. We compare our unified approach with three alternatives (both probabilistic and nonprobabilistic) where either the denoising of the GPS data and the detection of the high-level activities are strictly separated, or the states of the players are not considered, or both.

This paper provides a concrete formalization of relational POMDPs making several technical contributions toward their solution.

Recently, Tian et al. proposed a new dynamic programming algorithm which computes marginalized posterior probabilities of directed edge features over all the possible structures in O(n3n) time when the number of parents per node is bounded by a constant, where n is the number of variables of interest. However the main drawback of this approach is that deciding a single appropriate threshold for the existence of the directed edge feature is difficult due to the scale difference of the posterior probabilities between the directed edges forming v-structures and the directed edges not forming v-structures. We claim that computing posterior probabilities of both adjacencies and v-structures is necessary and more effective for discovering causal graphical features, since it allows us to find a single appropriate decision threshold for the existence of the feature that we are testing.

Recently, lifted belief propagation (LBP) has been proposed as an efficient approximate solution  of this inference problem. It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together  if they have â roughly speaking â identical computation trees, the tree-structured âunrollingâ  of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths.  Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their  computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in  each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while  not degrading performance. Above all, we show   that iLBP is faster than BP when solving the problem of distributing data to a large network, an  important real-world application where BP is faster than uninformed LBP.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1845/2173,Lifted Inference; Belief Propagation; Statistical Relational Learning; Content Distribution
188,2010,Reasoning Under Uncertainty,Efficient Belief Propagation for Utility Maximization and Repeated Inference,"Aniruddh Nath, Pedro Domingos","Many problems require repeated inference on probabilistic graphical models, with different values for evidence variables or other changes. Examples of such problems include utility maximization, MAP inference, online and interactive inference, parameter and structure learning, and dynamic inference. Since small changes to the evidence typically only affect a small region of the network, repeatedly performing inference from scratch can be massively redundant. In this paper, we propose expanding frontier belief propagation (EFBP), an efficient approximate algorithm for probabilistic inference with incremental changes to the evidence (or model). EFBP is an extension of loopy belief propagation (BP) where each run of inference reuses results from the previous ones, instead of starting from scratch with the new evidence; messages are only propagated in regions of the network affected by the changes. We provide theoretical guarantees bounding the difference in beliefs generated by EFBP and standard BP, and apply EFBP to the problem of expected utility maximization in influence diagrams. Experiments on viral marketing and combinatorial auction problems show that EFBP can converge much faster than BP without significantly affecting the quality of the solutions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1898/2174,Probabilistic Inference; Relational Probabilistic Models; Graphical Models

The same is true in many other problems that require repeated inference, like utility maximization, MAP inference, interactive inference, parameter and structure learning, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for updating the structure of an existing lifted network with incremental changes to the evidence. This allows us to construct the lifted network once for the initial inference problem, and amortize the cost over the subsequent problems.

Since the learner has  a budget, the problemâs duration is finite. Consequently an  optimal exploitation policy is not to pull the optimal arm repeatedly, but to pull the combination of arms that maximises  the agentâs total reward within the budget. As such, the rewards  for all arms must be estimated, because any of them  may appear in the optimal combination. This difference from  existing MABs means that new approaches to maximising the  total reward are required. To this end, we propose an epsilonâfirst  algorithm, in which the first epsilon of the budget is used solely  to learn the armsâ rewards (exploration), while the remaining  1 â epsilon is used to maximise the received reward based on those estimates (exploitation). We derive bounds on the algorithmâs  loss for generic and uniform exploration methods, and compare  its performance with traditional MAB algorithms under  various distributions of rewards and costs, showing that it outperforms  the others by up to 50%.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1817/2179,sequential decision making; unsupervised learning; multi-armed bandits

In this paper, we experimentally evaluate and compare three methods for conditional density estimation for their suitability in QSAR modeling. In contrast to traditional methods for conditional density estimation, they are based on generic machine learning schemes, more specifically, class probability estimators. Our experiments show that a kernel estimator based on class probability estimates from a random forest classifier is highly competitive with Gaussian process regression, while taking only a fraction of the time for training.

We develop a technology for such problems, and use it to address the challenge of finding the concentrations of the chemicals that appear in a complex mixture, based on its one-dimensional 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. As each chemical involves clusters of spatially localized peaks, this requires finding the shifts for the clusters and the concentrations of the chemicals, that collectively pro- duce the best match to the observed NMR spectrum. Here, each sub-problem requires finding the chemical concentrations and cluster shifts that can appear within a limited spectrum range; these are coupled as these limited regions can share many chemicals, and so must agree on the concentrations and cluster shifts of the common chemicals.

203,2010,AI and Bioinformatics Special Track,A Fast Heuristic Search Algorithm for Finding the Longest Common Subsequence of Multiple Strings,"Qingguo Wang, Mian Pan, Yi Shang, Dmitry Korkin","Finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of multiple strings is an NP-hard problem, with many applications in the areas of bioinformatics and computational genomics. Although significant efforts have been made to address the problem and its special cases, the increasing complexity and size of biological data require more efficient methods applicable to an arbitrary number of strings. In this paper, a novel search algorithm, MLCS-A*, is presented for the general case of multiple LCS (or MLCS) problems. MLCS-A* is a variant of the A* algorithm. It maximizes a new heuristic estimate of the LCS in each search step so that the longest common subsequence can be found. As a natural extension of MLCS-A*, a fast algorithm, MLCS-APP, is also proposed to deal with large volume of biological data for which finding a LCS within reasonable time is impossible. The benchmark test shows that MLCS-APP is able to extract common subsequences close to the optimal ones and that MLCS-APP significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches. When applied to 8 protein domain families, MLCS-APP produced more accurate results than existing multiple sequence alignment methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1559/2197,A*; Search; Longest Common Subsequence; Multiple Longest Common Subsequence; Computational Biology

However, with the increasing amount of multimedia data such as image, audio and video on the Web, the need for recommending advertisement for the multimedia data is becoming a reality. In this paper, we address the novel problem of visual contextual advertising, which is to directly advertise when users are viewing images which do not have any surrounding text. A key challenging issue of visual contextual advertising is that images and advertisements are usually represented in image space and word space respectively, which are quite different with each other inherently. As a result, existing methods for Web page advertising are inapplicable since they represent both Web pages and advertisement in the same word space. In order to solve the problem, we propose to exploit the social Web to link these two feature spaces together. In particular, we present a unified generative model to integrate advertisements, words and images. Specifically, our solution combines two parts in a principled approach: First, we transform images from a image feature space to a word space utilizing the knowledge from images with annotations from social Web. Then, a language model based approach is applied to estimate the relevance between transformed images and advertisements. Moreover, in this model, the probability of recommending an advertisement can be inferred efficiently given an image, which enables potential applications to online advertising.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1757/2203,

These results typically include the title, link, and snippet of content from the target link. Each result has the potential to be useful or useless and thus reviewing it has a cost and potential benefit. This paper studies the behavior of a rational agent in this setting, whose objective is to maximize the probability of finding a satisfying result while minimizing cost. We propose two similar agents with different capabilities: one that only compares result snippets relatively and one that predicts from the result snippet whether the result will be satisfying. We prove that the optimal strategy for both agents is a stopping rule: the agent reviews a fixed number of results until the marginal cost is greater than the marginal expected benefit, maximizing the overall expected utility.

In this paper, we propose a novel prioritization approach where candidate pages from the corpus are ordered according to their expected contribution to the extraction results and those with higher estimated potential are extracted earlier. Systems employing this approach can stop the extraction process at any time when the resource gets scarce (i.e., not all pages in the corpus can be processed), without worrying about wasting extraction effort on unimportant pages. More specifically, we define a novel notion to measure the value of extraction results and design various mechanisms for estimating a candidate pageâs contribution to this value.

This is particularly important for ""recency sensitive"" queries such as breaking news queries. In this study, we propose a set of novel click features to improve machine learned recency ranking. Rather than computing simple aggregate click through rates, we derive these features using the temporal click through data and query reformulation chains. One of the features that we use is click buzz that captures the spiking interest of a url for a query. We also propose time weighted click through rates which treat recent observations as being exponentially more important. The promotion of fresh content is typically determined by the query intent which can change dynamically over time. Quite often users query reformulations convey clues about the query's intent. Hence we enrich our click features by following query reformulations which typically benefit the first query in the chain of reformulations. Our experiments show these novel features can improve the NDCG5 of a major online search engine's ranking for ""recency sensitive"" queries by up to 1.57%.

Recently, topic models have been introduced for the simultaneous analysis for topics and the sentiment in a document. These studies, which jointly model topic and sentiment, take the advantage of the relationship between topics and sentiment, and are shown to be superior to traditional sentiment analysis tools. However, most of them make the assumption that, given the parameters, the sentiments of the words in the document are all independent. In our observation, in contrast, sentiments are expressed in a coherent way. The local conjunctive words, such as âandâ or âbutâ, are often indicative of sentiment transitions.  In this paper, we propose a major departure from the previous approaches by making two linked contributions. First, we assume that the sentiments are related to the topic in the document, and put forward a joint sentiment and topic model, i.e. Sentiment-LDA. Second, we observe that sentiments are dependent on local context. Thus, we further extend the Sentiment-LDA model to Dependency-Sentiment-LDA model by relaxing the sentiment independent assumption in Sentiment-LDA. The sentiments of words are viewed as a Markov chain in Dependency-Sentiment-LDA. Through experiments, we show that exploiting the sentiment dependency is clearly advantageous, and that the Dependency-Sentiment-LDA is an effective approach for sentiment analysis.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1913/2215,Sentiment Analysis; Topic Model; Sentiment Classification
217,2010,AI and the Web Special Track,Subjective Trust Inference in Composite Services,"Lei Li, Yan Wang","In Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) environments, the trustworthiness of each service is critical for a service client when selecting one from a large pool of services. The trust value of a service is usually in the range of [0,1] and is evaluated from the ratings given by service clients, which represent the subjective belief of these service clients on the satisfaction of delivered services. So a trust value can be taken as the subjective probability, with which one party believes that another party can perform an action in a certain situation. Hence, subjective probability theory should be adopted in trust evaluation. In addition, in SOC environments, a service usually invokes other services offered by different service providers forming a composite service. Thus, the global trust of a composite service should be evaluated based on complex invocation structures.   In this paper, firstly, based on Bayesian inference, we propose a novel method to evaluate the subjective trustworthiness of a service component from a series of ratings given by service clients. Secondly, we interpret the trust dependency caused by service invocations as conditional probability, which is evaluated based on the subjective trust values of service components. Furthermore, we propose a joint subjective probability method to evaluate the subjective global trust of a composite service on the basis of trust dependency.

We then model the optimal social trust path selection as a Multi-Constrained Optimal Path (MCOP) selection problem which is NP-Complete.

Advanced semantic web ontologies, especially in medicine and science, are developing.   As more complex ontologies are developed, there is a growing need for efficient queries that handle inference.  In areas such as research, it is vital to be able to perform queries that retrieve not just facts but also inferred knowledge and uncertain information.   OWL (Web Ontology Language) defines rules that govern provable inference in semantic web datasets.   In this paper, we detail a database schema using bit vectors that is designed specifically for RDF datasets.  We introduce a framework for materializing and storing inferred triples. Our bit vector schema enables storage of inferred knowledge without a query performance penalty.  Inference queries are simplified and performance is improved.  Our evaluation results demonstrate that our inference solution is more scalable and efficient than the current state-of-the-art.  There are also standards being developed for representing probabilistic reasoning within OWL ontologies.

Usually, only the textual features are used in burst detection. In the theme extraction from current prevailing social media content, it is necessary to consider not only textual features but also the pervasive collaborative context, e.g., resource lifetime and user activity. This paper explores novel approaches to combine multiple sources of such indication for better burst extraction. We systematically investigate the characters of collaborative context, i.e., metadata frequency, topic coverage and user  attractiveness. First, a robust state based model is utilized to detect bursts from individual streams. We then propose a learning method to combine these burst pulses.

Lyu, Irwin King","Social tagging systems have emerged as an effective way for users to annotate and share objects on the Web. However, with the growth of social tagging systems, users are easily overwhelmed by the large amount of data and it is very difficult for users to dig out information that he/she is interested in. Though the tagging system has provided interest-based social network features to enable the user to keep track of other users' tagging activities, there is still no automatic and effective way for the user to discover other users with common interests. In this paper, we propose a User Recommendation (UserRec) framework for user interest modeling and interest-based user recommendation, aiming to boost information sharing among users with similar interests. Our work brings three major contributions to the research community: (1) we propose a tag-graph based community detection method to model the users' personal interests, which are further represented by discrete topic distributions; (2) the similarity values between users' topic distributions are measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence), and the similarity values are further used to perform interest-based user recommendation; and (3) by analyzing users' roles in a tagging system, we find users' roles in a tagging system are similar to Web pages in the Internet. Experiments on tagging dataset of Web pages (Yahoo!~Delicious) show that UserRec outperforms other state-of-the-art recommender system approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1927/2237,User Recommendation; Tagging System; User Interests Modeling
235,2010,Challenges in AI Special Track,Automated Modelling and Solving in Constraint Programming,Barry O'Sullivan,"Constraint programming can be divided very crudely into modeling and solving. Modeling defines the problem, in terms of variables that can take on different values, subject to restrictions (constraints) on which combinations of variables are allowed. Solving finds values for all the variables that simultaneously satisfy all the constraints. However, the impact of constraint programming has been constrained by a lack of ""user-friendliness''. Constraint programming has a major ""declarative"" aspect, in that a problem model can be handed off for solution to a variety of standard solving methods. These methods are embedded in algorithms, libraries, or specialized constraint programming languages. To fully exploit this declarative opportunity however, we must provide more assistance and automation in the modeling process, as well as in the design of application-specific problem solvers. Automated modelling and solving in constraint programming presents a major challenge for the artificial intelligence community. Artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning, is a natural field in which to explore opportunities for moving more of the burden of constraint programming from the user to the machine. This paper presents technical challenges in the areas of constraint model acquisition, formulation and reformulation, synthesis of filtering algorithms for global constraints, and automated solving.

Soon, users will interact with many new markets, perhaps without even knowing it: when driving their car, when listening to a song, when backing up their files, or when surfing the web. We argue that these new systems can only be successful if a new approach is chosen towards designing them. In this paper we introduce the general problem of ""Hidden Market Design."" The design of a ""weakly hidden"" market involves reducing some of the market complexities and providing a user interface (UI) that makes the interaction seamless for the user. A ""strongly hidden market"" is one where some semantic aspect of a market is hidden altogether (e.g., budgets, prices, combinatorial constraints). We show that the intersection of UI design and market design is of particular importance for this research agenda. To illustrate hidden market design, we give a series of potential applications. We hope that the problem of hidden market design will inspire other researchers and lead to new research in this direction, paving the way for more successful market-based systems in the future.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1804/2240,market design; UI design; e-commerce; HCI

239,2010,Integrated Intelligence Special Track,Creating Dynamic Story Plots with Continual Multiagent Planning,Michael Brenner,"An AI system that is to create a story (autonomously or in interaction with human users) requires capabilities from many subfields of AI in order to create characters that themselves appear to act intelligently and believably in a coherent story world. Specifically, the system must be able to reason about the physical actions and verbal interactions of the characters as well as their perceptions of the world. Furthermore it must make the characters act believably--i.e. in a goal-directed yet emotionally plausible fashion. Finally, it must cope with (and embrace!) the dynamics of a multiagent environment where beliefs, sentiments, and goals may change during the course of a story and where plans are thwarted, adapted and dropped all the time.Â  In this paper, we describe a representational and algorithmic framework for modelling such dynamic story worlds, Continual Multiagent Planning. It combines continual planning (i.e. an integrated approach to planning and execution) with a rich description language for modelling epistemic and affective states, desires and intentions, sensing and communication.

Sketch understanding is used to automatically encode stimuli in the form of comic strips.

242,2010,Integrated Intelligence Special Track,Integrating Constraint Satisfaction and Spatial Reasoning,"Unmesh Kurup, Nicholas L. Cassimatis","Many problems in AI, including planning, logical reasoning and probabilistic inference, have been shown to reduce to (weighted) constraint satisfaction. While there are a number of approaches for solving such problems, the recent gains in efficiency of the satisfiability approach have made SAT solvers a popular choice. Modern propositional SAT solvers are efficient for a wide variety of problems. However, particularly in the case of spatial reasoning, conversion to propositional SAT can sometimes result in a large number of variables and/or clauses. Moreover, spatial reasoning problems can often be more efficiently solved if the agent is able to exploit the geometric nature of space to make better choices during search and backtracking. The result of these two drawbacks â larger problem sizes and inefficient search â is that even simple spatial constraint problems are often intractable in the SAT approach. In this paper we propose a spatial reasoning system that provides significant performance improvements in constraint satisfaction problems involving spatial predicates. The key to our approach is to integrate a diagrammatic representation with a DPLL-based backtracking algorithm that is specialized for spatial reasoning. The resulting integrated system can be applied to larger and more complex problems than current approaches and can be adopted to improve performance in a variety of problems ranging from planning to probabilistic inference",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1889/2248,spatial reasoning; Satisfiability-Modulo Theories

247,2010,Integrated Intelligence Special Track,Using Imagery to Simplify Perceptual Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning Agents,Samuel Wintermute,"In this paper, we consider the problem of reinforcement learning in spatial tasks. These tasks have many states that can be aggregated together to improve learning efficiency. In an agent, this aggregation can take the form of selecting appropriate perceptual processes to arrive at a qualitative abstraction of the underlying continuous state. However, for arbitrary problems, an agent is unlikely to have the perceptual processes necessary to discriminate all relevant states in terms of such an abstraction.To help compensate for this, reinforcement learning can be integrated with an imagery system, where simple models of physical processes are applied within a low-level perceptual representation to predict the state resulting from an action. Rather than abstracting the current state, abstraction can be applied to the predicted next state. Formally, it is shown that this integration broadens the class of perceptual abstraction methods that can be used while preserving the underlying problem. Empirically, it is shown that this approach can be used in complex domains, and can be beneficial even when formal requirements are not met.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1767/2258,reinforcement learning; imagery; abstraction; cognitive architecture; Soar; state-action aggregation; state aggregation; spatial reasoning

We propose modeling the mobility patterns of moving agents as a mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior over mixture weights. The GP provides a flexible representation for each individual mobility pattern, while the DP assigns observed trajectories to particular mobility patterns. Both the GPs and the DP adjust the model's complexity based on available data, implicitly avoiding issues of over-fitting or under-fitting.

Common analytical approaches to biped walk use simplified models of the physical reality. Such approaches are partially successful as they lead to failures of the robot walk in terms of unavoidable falls. Instead of further refining the analytical models, in this work we investigate the use of human corrective demonstrations, as we realize that a human can visually detect when the robot may be falling. We contribute a two-phase biped walk learning approach, which we experiment on the Aldebaran NAO humanoid robot. In the first phase, the robot walks following an analytical simplified walk algorithm, which is used as a black box, and we identify and save a walk cycle as joint motion commands. We then show how the robot can repeatedly and successfully play back the recorded motion cycle, even if in open-loop. In the second phase, we create a closed-loop walk by modifying the recorded walk cycle to respond to sensory data. The algorithm learns joint movement corrections to the open-loop walk based on the corrective feedback provided by a human, and on the sensory data, while walking autonomously. In our experimental results, we show that the learned closed-loop walking policy outperforms a hand-tuned closed-loop policy and the open-loop playback walk, in terms of the distance traveled by the robot without falling.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1923/2262,"Biped Walking, Learning from Demonstration"

Lane, Tanzeem Choudhury, Andrew T. Campbell","Modeling human behavior requires vast quantities of accurately labeled training data, but for ubiquitous people-aware applications such data is rarely attainable. Even researchers make mistakes when labeling data, and consistent, reliable labels from low-commitment users are rare. In particular, users may give identical labels to activities with characteristically different signatures (e.g., labeling eating at home or at a restaurant as ""dinner"") or may give different labels to the same context (e.g., ""work"" vs. ""office""). In this scenario, labels are unreliable but nonetheless contain valuable information for classification. To facilitate learning in such unconstrained labeling scenarios, we propose Community-Guided Learning (CGL), a framework that allows existing classifiers to learn robustly from unreliably-labeled user-submitted data. CGL exploits the underlying structure in the data and the unconstrained labels to intelligently group crowd-sourced data.

Research in psychology has shown that the use of multiple exploratory behaviors is crucial for learning about objects. Inspired by such research, recent work in robotics has demonstrated that by performing multiple exploratory behaviors a robot can dramatically improve its object recognition rate. But what is the cause of this improvement? To answer this question, this paper examines the conditions under which combining information from multiple behaviors and sensory modalities leads to better object recognition results. Two different problems are considered: interactive object recognition using auditory and proprioceptive feedback, and surface texture recognition using tactile and proprioceptive feedback. Analysis of the results shows that metrics designed to estimate classifier model diversity can explain the improvement in recognition accuracy.

Since a rare bird only appears in front of the camera with very low occurrence (e.g. less than ten times per year) for very short duration (e.g. less than a fraction of a second), our algorithm must have very low false negative rate. We verify the bird body axis information with the known bird flying dynamics from the short video segment. Since a regular extended Kalman filter (EKF) cannot converge due to high measurement error and limited data, we develop a novel Probable Observation Data Set (PODS)-based EKF method. The new PODS-EKF searches the measurement error range for all probable observation data that ensures the convergence of the corresponding EKF in short time frame. The algorithm has been extensively tested in experiments.

What makes the task difficult is that the appearance of humans in range data can change drastically as a function of body pose, distance to the sensor, self-occlusion and occlusion by other objects. In this paper we propose a novel approach to pedestrian detection in 3D range data based on supervised learning techniques to create a bank of classifiers for different height levels of the human body. In particular, our approach applies AdaBoost to train a strong classifier from geometrical and statistical features of groups of neighboring points at the same height. In a second step, the AdaBoost classifiers mutually enforce their evidence across different heights by voting into a continuous space. Pedestrians are finally found efficiently by mean-shift search for local maxima in the voting space.

It is assumed that all such activities are produced from an underlying set of event class generators. The learning task is then to recover this generative process from visual data. A set of event classes is derived from the most likely decomposition of the tracks into a set of labelled events involving subsets of interacting tracks. Interactions between subsets of tracks are modelled as a relational graph structure that captures qualitative spatio-temporal relationships between these tracks. The posterior probability of candidate solutions favours decompositions in which events of the same class have a similar relational structure, together with other measures of well-formedness. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure is used to efficiently search for the MAP solution. This search moves between possible decompositions of the tracks into sets of unlabelled events and at each move adds a close to optimal labelling (for this decomposition) using spectral clustering.

259,2010,Physically Grounded AI Special Track,Error Aware Monocular Visual Odometry using Vertical Line Pairs for Small Robots in Urban Areas,"Ji Zhang, Dezhen Song","We report a new error-aware monocular visual odometry method that only uses vertical lines, such as vertical edges of buildings and poles in urban areas as landmarks. Since vertical lines are easy to extract, insensitive to lighting conditions/ shadows, and sensitive to robot movements on the ground plane, they are robust features if compared with regular point features or line features. We derive a recursive visual odometry method based on the vertical line pairs. We analyze how errors are propagated and introduced in the continuous odometry process by deriving the closed form representation of covariance matrix. We formulate the minimum variance ego-motion estimation problem and present a method that outputs weights for different vertical line pairs. The resulting visual odometry method is tested in physical experiments and compared with two existing methods that are based on point features and line features, respectively. The experiment results show that our method outperforms its two counterparts in robustness, accuracy, and speed. The relative errors of our method are less than 2% in experiments.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1587/2271,"Vertical line, vision odometry, mobile robots"

A number of methods that exploit both local and relational information have been developed for this task. Acquiring the labels for a few nodes at inference time can greatly improve the accuracy, however the question of figuring out which node labels to acquire is challenging.

In contrast to the policies obtained from MDPs and POMDPs, finite-state controllers have two advantages: they are often extremely compact, and they are general, applying to many problems and not just one. A limitation of finite-state controllers, on the other hand, is that they are written by hand. In this paper, we address this limitation, presenting a method for deriving controllers automatically from models. The models represent a class of contingent problems where actions are deterministic and some fluents are observable. The problem of deriving a controller is converted into a conformant problem that is solved using classical planners, taking advantage of a complete translation into classical planning introduced recently. The controllers derived are âgeneralâ in the sense that they do not solve the original problem only, but many variations as well, including changes in the size of the problem or in the uncertainty of the initial situation and action effects. Several experiments illustrating the automatic derivation of controllers are presented.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1783/2274,Controllers; Robotics; Contingent planning; Conformant planning; Translation; POMDP

The undecidability of reasoning on ASP with functions, implied that functions were subject to severe restrictions or disallowed at all, drastically limiting ASP applicability. We overcame most of the technical difficulties preventing this introduction, and we singled out a highly expressive class of programs with functions (FG-programs), allowing the (possibly recursive) use of function terms in the full ASP language with disjunction and negation. Reasoning on FG-programs is decidable, and they can express any computable function (causing membership in this class to be semi-decidable). We singled out also FD-programs, a subset of FG-programs which are effectively recognizable, while keeping the computability of reasoning. We implemented all results into the DLV system, thus obtaining an ASP system allowing to encode any computable function in a rich and fully declarative KRR language, ensuring termination on every FG program. Finally, we singled out the class of DFRP programs, where decidability of reasoning is guaranteed and Prolog-like functions are allowed.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1563/2276,ASP; answer set programming; KRR; knowledge representation and reasoning; function symbols; logic programming

To this end, a large number of special purpose systems and techniques have been developed for solving such constraint-based mining and learning problems. These techniques have, so far, been developed independently of the general purpose tools and principles of constraint programming known within the field of artificial intelligence. This paper shows that off-the-shelf constraint programming techniques can be applied to various pattern mining and rule learning problems (cf. also (De Raedt, Guns, and Nijssen 2008; Nijssen, Guns, and De Raedt 2009)).

In mechanism design, the goal is to design procedures (mechanisms) for making the decision that work in spite of such strategic behavior, usually by making untruthful behavior suboptimal. In automated mechanism design, the idea is to computationally search through the space of feasible mechanisms, rather than to design them analytically by hand. Unfortunately, the most straightforward approach to automated mechanism design does not scale to large instances, because it requires searching over a very large space of possible functions. In this paper, we describe an approach to automated mechanism design that is computationally feasible. Instead of optimizing over all feasible mechanisms, we carefully choose a parameterized subfamily of mechanisms. Then we optimize over mechanisms within this family, and analyze whether and to what extent the resulting mechanism is suboptimal outside the subfamily. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with two case studies.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1868/2279,mechanism design; automated mechanism design; prior-free

The challenge is to select a finite number of boundaries for the segments so as to optimize an objective error function defined over those segments. Although this optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time, the algorithm which achieves the minimum error does not scale well, hence it is not practical for applications with massive data sets. There is considerable research with numerous approximation and heuristic algorithms. Still, none of those approaches has resolved the quality-efficiency tradeoff in a satisfactory manner. In (Halim, Karras, and Yap 2009), we obtain near linear time algorithms which achieve both the desired scalability and near-optimal quality, thus dominating earlier approaches.

First, we compile over 630 freely available dictionaries over the Web and convert this data into a single representation â the translation graph. Second, we build several inference algorithms that infer translations between word pairs even when no dictionary lists them as translations. Finally, we run our inference procedure offline to construct PANDICTIONARYâ a sense-distinguished, massively multilingual dictionary that has translations in more than 1000 languages.

285,2010,Emerging Application or Methodology,Predicting Falls of a Humanoid Robot through Machine Learning,"Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan, Ambarish Goswami","Although falls are undesirable in humanoid robots, they are also inevitable, especially as robots get deployed in physically interactive human environments. We consider the problem of fall prediction, i.e., to predict if a robot's balance controller can prevent a fall from the current state. A trigger from the fall predictor is used to switch the robot from a balance maintenance mode to a fall control mode. Hence, it is desirable for the fall predictor to signal imminent falls with sufficient lead time before the actual fall, while minimizing false alarms. Analytical techniques and intuitive rules fail to satisfy these competing objectives on a large robot that is subjected to strong disturbances and therefore exhibits complex dynamics. Today effective supervised learning tools are available for finding patterns in high-dimensional data. Our paper contributes a novel approach to engineer fall data such that a supervised learning method can be exploited to achieve reliable prediction. Specifically, we introduce parameters to control the tradeoff between the false positive rate and lead time. Several parameter combinations yield solutions that improve both the false positive rate and the lead time of hand-coded solutions. Learned predictors are decision lists with typical depths of 5-10, in a 16-dimensional feature space.

To further explore the use of model-based control in anesthesia, we investigated the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in the delivery of patient-specific, propofol-induced hypnosis in human volunteers.

288,2010,Emerging Application or Methodology,Towards Applying Interactive POMDPs to Real-World Adversary Modeling,"Brenda Ng, Carol Meyers, Kofi Boakye, John Nitao","We examine the suitability of using decision processes to model real-world systems of intelligent adversaries. Decision processes have long been used to study cooperative multiagent interactions, but their practical applicability to adversarial problems has received minimal study. We address the pros and cons of applying sequential decision-making in this area, using the crime of money laundering as a specific example. Motivated by case studies, we abstract out a model of the money laundering process, using the framework of interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs).  We address why this framework is well suited for modeling adversarial interactions. Particle filtering and value iteration are used to solve the model, with the application of different pruning and look-ahead strategies to assess the tradeoffs between solution quality and algorithmic run time. Our results show that there is a large gap in the level of realism that can currently be achieved by such decision models, largely due to computational demands that limit the size of problems that can be solved. While these results represent solutions to a simplified model of money laundering, they illustrate nonetheless the kinds of agent interactions that cannot be captured by standard approaches such as anomaly detection. This implies that I-POMDP methods may be valuable in the future, when algorithmic capabilities have further evolved.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI10/paper/viewFile/1553/2360,agents; planning; multidisciplinary topics and applications :: game theory; multidisciplinary topics and applications :: government

A practical solution to the problem could have far reaching implications in many industries, such as home entertainment. In this work, we consider the problem of identity inference using a TV remote control. In particular, we address two challenges that have so far prevented the work of Chang et al.

Second, we generalize our results to partially labeled data. To achieve our goal, we use state-of-the-art methods for max-margin learning and online convex programming. Our solution is efficient, runs in real time, and comes with theoretical guarantees.

This is an exciting application for some core aspects of Artificial Intelligence research since the automation must be designed to enable the human operators to access and process a myriad of information sources, understand heightened system complexity, and maximize capacity, throughput and fuel savings in the NAS..  This paper introduces an emerging application of techniques from mixed initiative (adjustable autonomy), multi-agent systems, and task scheduling techniques to the air traffic control domain.  Consequently, we have created a testbed for investigating the critical challenges in supporting the early design of systems that allow for optimal, context-sensitive function (role) allocation between air traffic controller and automated agents.

Parvathy, Abhishek Kumar, John Wesley, Rajesh Blakrishnan","Much of the ongoing explosion of digital content is in the form of text. This content is a virtual gold-mine of information that can inform a range of social, governmental, and business decisions. For example, using content available on blogs and social networking sites businesses can find out what its customers are saying about their products and services. In the digital age where customer is king, the business value of ascertaining consumer sentiment cannot be overstated. People express sentiments in myriad ways. At times, they use simple, direct assertions, but most often they use sentences involving comparisons, conjunctions expressing multiple and possibly opposing sentiments about multiple features and entities,and pronominal references whose resolution requires discourse level context. Frequently people use abbreviations, slang, SMSese, idioms and metaphors. Understanding the latter also requires common sense reasoning. In this paper, we present    iSEE, a fully implemented sentiment extraction engine, which makes use of statistical methods, classical NLU techniques, common sense reasoning, and probabilistic inference to extract entity and feature specific sentiment from complex sentences and dialog.

In this paper we focus on hypoxia (or oxygen deprivation), a very serious condition that can arise from different pathologies and can lead to life-long disability and death. We present a novel approach to hypoxia detection based on recordings of the uterine pressure and fetal heart rate, which are routinely monitored during labor. The key idea is to learn models of the fetal response to signals from its environment, using time series data recorded during labor. Then, we use the parameters of these models as attributes in a binary classification problem. A majority vote over several periods is taken to provide the current label for the fetus. We use a unique database of real clinical recordings, both from normal and pathological cases. Our approach classifies correctly more than half the pathological cases, 1.5 hours before delivery. These are cases that were missed by clinicians; early detection of this type would have allowed the physician to perform a Caesarean section, possibly avoiding the negative outcome",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI10/paper/viewFile/1597/2372,

In prior work, we have illustrated the potential of this approach both in providing scaffolding, building an inexpensive robotics laboratory, and also providing control of evaluation of robotics environments for student evaluation and scientific experimentation.  In this paper, we explore integrating extensions and improvements to the mixed reality components themselves as part of a course in applied artificial intelligence and robotics.

323,2010,Student Abstracts,Evolved Intrinsic Reward Functions for Reinforcement Learning,Scott Niekum,"Reward functions in reinforcement learning have largely been assumed given as part of the problem being solved by the agent. However, the psychological notion of intrinsic motivation has recently inspired inquiry into whether there exist alternate reward functions that enable an agent to learn a task more easily than the natural task-based reward function allows. This paper presents an efficient genetic programming algorithm to search for alternate reward functions that improve agent learning performance.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1595/2319,intrinsic motivation; reinforcement learning; genetic programming

325,2010,Student Abstracts,Semantic Search in Linked Data: Opportunities and Challenges,Hamid Haidarian Shahri,"In this abstract, we compare semantic search (in the RDF model) with keyword search (in the relational model), and illustrate how these two search paradigms are different. This comparison addresses the following questions: (1) What can semantic search achieve that keyword search can not (in terms of behavior)? (2) Why is it difficult to simulate semantic search, using keyword search on the relational data model? We use the term keyword search, when the search is performed on data stored in the relational data model, as in traditional relational databases, and an example of keyword search in databases is [Hri02]. We use the term semantic search, when the search is performed on data stored in the RDF data model. Note that when the data is modeled in RDF, it inherently contains explicit typed relations or semantics, and hence the use of the term âsemantic search.â Let us begin with an example, to illustrate the differences between semantic search and keyword search.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1640/2321,Semantic Search; Linked Data

Such a comparison can be quantified by determining the number of events that change the order of genes in a genome. Earlier Erdem and Tillier formulated the pairwise comparison of entire genomes as the problem of planning rearrangement events that transform one genome to the other. We reformulate this problem as a planning problem to extend its applicability to genomes with multiple copies of genes and with unequal gene content, and illustrate its applicability and effectiveness on three real datasets: mitochondrial genomes of Metazoa, chloroplast genomes of Campanulaceae, chloroplast genomes of various land plants and green algae.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1664/2324,planning

331,2010,General Papers,Preferences and Learning in Multi-Agent Negotiation,Reyhan Aydogan,"In online, dynamic environments, the service requested by consumers may not be readily served by the producers. This requires the consumers and producers to negotiate on the content of the service. To automate this process, agents play a key role in e-commerce. As far as the agents' negotiation strategies are concerned, understanding and reasoning on their users' preferences are important to generate the right offers on behalf of their users. Besides taking other participant's needs into account is important to be able to negotiate effectively. However, preferences of participants are almost always private. The best that can happen is that participants may learn each other's preferences through interactions over time. As agents learn each other's preferences, they can provide better-targeted offers and thus enable faster negotiation. My research direction involves representing and reasoning on preferences, and learning preferences though interaction in automated negotiation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC10/paper/viewFile/1632/2375,Negotiation;Preference;Learning

Learned tasks and plans are recorded for future use.

334,2010,General Papers,Local Optimization for Simulation of Natural Motion,Tom Erez,Reinforcement Learning is a theoretical framework for optimizing the behavior of artificial agents.  The notion that behavior in the natural world is in some sense optimal is explored by areas such as biomechanics and physical anthropology.  These fields propose a variety of candidate optimality criteria as possible formulations of the principles underlying natural motion.  Recent developments in computational biomechanics allow us to create articulated models of living creatures with a significant degree of biological realism.  I aim to bring these elements together in my research by using Reinforcement Learning to generate optimized behavior in biomechanical simulations.  Such a generative approach will allow us to examine critically postulated optimality criteria and investigate hypotheses that cannot be easily studied in the real world.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC10/paper/viewFile/1633/2381,reinforcement learning; biomechanics; optimal control

336,2010,General Papers,Detecting Social Ties and Copying Events from Afï¬liation Data,Lisa Friedland,"The goal of my work is to detect implicit social ties or closely-linked entities within a data set. In data consisting of people (or other entities) and their afï¬liations or discrete attributes, we identify unusually similar pairs of people, and we pose the question: Can their similarity be explained by chance, or it is due to a direct (âcopyingâ) relationship between the people? The thesis will explore how to assess this question, and in particular how oneâs judgments and conï¬dence depend not only on the two people in question but also on properties of the entire data set. I will provide a framework for solving this problem and experiment with it across multiple synthetic and real-world data sets. My approach requires a model of the copying relationship, a model of independent people, and a method for distinguishing between them. I will focus on two aspects of the problem: (1) choosing background models to ï¬t arbitrary, correlated afï¬liation data, and (2) understanding how the ability to detect copies is affected by factors like data sparsity and the numbers of people and afï¬liations, independent of the ï¬t of the models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC10/paper/viewFile/1647/2385,social network analysis; link prediction; affiliation network
337,2010,General Papers,Continual On-Line Planning,Sofia Lemons,"My research represents an approach to integrating planning and execution in time-sensitive environments.  The primary focus is on a problem called continual on-line planning.  New goals arrive stochastically during execution, the agent issues actions for execution one at a time, and the environment is otherwise deterministic. My dissertation will address this setting in three stages: optimizing total goal achievement time, handling on-line goal arrival during planning or execution, and adapting to changes in state also during planning or execution. My current approach to this problem is based on incremental heuristic search. The two central issues are the decision of which partial plans to elaborate during search and the decision of when to issue an action for execution.  I have proposed an extension of Russell and Wefald's decision-theoretic A* algorithm that is not limited by assumptions of an admissible heuristic like DTA*. This algorithm, Decision Theoretic On-line Continual Search (DTOCS), handles the complexities of the on-line setting by balancing deliberative planning and real-time response.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC10/paper/viewFile/1639/2387,planning; search; real-time; on-line; heuristic; meta-reasoning

342,2010,General Papers,Multi-Agent Fault Tolerance Inspired by a Computational Analysis of Cancer,Megan Olsen,"My thesis investigates fault tolerance for cooperative agent systems that have some equivalent of self-replication and self-death. Utilizing biologically-inspired mechanisms, I increase multi-agent system robustness for faulty agents when it is unknown exactly which agent is malfunctioning.  It is important to determine new ways to increase robustness of a system, as otherwise it cannot be guaranteed to function in all situations and thus cannot be relied upon. Robustness of a system allows agents to recover from errors and thus function continuously, an increasingly important trait as agent systems are deployed in real world scenarios such as sensor networks or surveillance systems where faulty or malicious nodes could disrupt application performance. To achieve robustness, there must either be prevention of all errors, or a technique for recovering from errors after they have occurred.  My thesis creates a new fault tolerance mechanism inspired by cancer biology to remove faulty agents, and then re-applies the developed technique to study the removal of biological cancer cells in simulation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC10/paper/viewFile/1631/2394,multi-agent systems; fault tolerance; biologically inspired computing

This strategy will help our language achieve adaptivity, modularity, and, most importantly, accessibility to behavioral scientists.

How to design and analyze desirable voting rules has been studied by economists for centuries. In recent decades, technological advances, especially those in internet economy, have introduced many new applications for voting theory. For example, we can rate movies based on peopleâs preferences, as done on many movie recommendation sites. However, in such new applications, we always encounter a large number of alternatives or an overwhelming amount of information, which makes computation in voting process a big challenge. Such challenges have led to a burgeoning areaâcomputational social choice, aiming to address problems in computational aspects of preference representation and aggregation in a multi-agent scenario.  The high-level goal of my research is to better understand and prevent the agentsâ (strategic) behavior in voting systems, as well as to design computationally efficient ways for agents to present their preferences and make a joint decision.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC10/paper/viewFile/1618/2399,Computational social choice; manipulation; multi-issue domain
