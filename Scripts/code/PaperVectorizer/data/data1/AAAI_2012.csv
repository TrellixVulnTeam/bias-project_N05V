0,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Combining Hashing and Abstraction in Sparse High Dimensional Feature Spaces,"Cornelia Caragea, Adrian Silvescu, Prasenjit Mitra","With the exponential increase in the number of documents available online, e.g., news articles, weblogs, scientific documents, the development of effective and efficient classification methods is needed. The performance of document classifiers critically depends, among other things, on the choice of the feature representation. The commonly used ""bag of words"" and n-gram representations can result in prohibitively high dimensional input spaces. Data mining algorithms applied to these input spaces may be intractable due to the large number of dimensions. Thus, dimensionality reduction algorithms that can process data into features fast at runtime, ideally in  constant time per feature, are greatly needed in high throughput applications, where the number of features and data points can be in the order of millions. One promising line of research to dimensionality reduction is feature clustering. We propose to combine two types of feature clustering, namely hashing and abstraction based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering, in order to take advantage of the strengths of both techniques. Experimental results on two text data sets show that the combined approach uses significantly smaller number of features and gives similar performance when compared with the ""bag of words"" and n-gram approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5087/5111,feature clustering;feature abstraction;feature hashing;
1,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,SPARQL Query Containment Under SHI Axioms,"Melisachew Wudage Chekol, Jérôme Euzenat, Pierre Genevès, Nabil Layaïda","SPARQL query containment under schema axioms is the problem of determining whether, for any RDF graph satisfying a given set of schema axioms, the answers to a query are contained in the answers of another query. This problem has major applications for verification and optimization of queries. In order to solve it, we rely on the mu-calculus. Firstly, we provide a mapping from RDF graphs into transition systems. Secondly, SPARQL queries and RDFS and SHI axioms are encoded into mu-calculus formulas. This allows us to reduce query containment and equivalence to satisfiability in the mu-calculus. Finally, we prove a double exponential upper bound for containment under SHI schema axioms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4924/5112,"Query Containment, SPARQL, RDF, SHI Axioms"
2,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Fused Matrix Factorization with Geographical and Social Influence in Location-Based Social Networks,"Chen Cheng, Haiqin Yang, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu","Recently, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Foursquare, Facebook, and Brightkite, etc., have attracted millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins. The available check-in information makes it possible to mine users’ preference on locations and to provide favorite recommendations. Personalized Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in LBSNs since it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers to provide personalized services. To solve this task, matrix factorization is a promising tool due to its success in recommender systems. However, previously proposed matrix factorization (MF) methods do not explore geographical influence, e.g., multi-center check-in property, which yields suboptimal solutions for the recommendation. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fuse MF with geographical and social influence for POI recommendation in LBSNs. We first capture the geographical influence via modeling the probability of a user’s check-in on a location as a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM). Next, we include social information and fuse the geographical influence into a generalized matrix factorization framework. Our solution to POI recommendation is efficient and scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally, we conduct thorough experiments on a large-scale real-world LBSNs dataset and demonstrate that the fused matrix factorization framework with MGM utilizes the distance information sufficiently and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4748/5113,POI recommendation; matrix factorization; MGM
3,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Building Contextual Anchor Text Representation using Graph Regularization,Na Dai,"Anchor texts are useful complementary description for target pages, widely applied to improve search relevance. The benefits come from the additional information introduced into document representation and the intelligent ways of estimating their relative importance. Previous work on anchor importance estimation treated anchor text independently without considering its context. As a result, the lack of constraints from such context fails to guarantee a stable anchor text representation. We propose an anchor graph regularization approach to incorporate constraints from such context into anchor text weighting process, casting the task into a convex quadratic optimization problem. The constraints draw from the estimation of anchor-anchor, anchor-page, and page-page similarity. Based on any estimators, our approach operates as a post process of refining the estimated anchor weights, making it a plug and play component in search infrastructure. Comparable experiments on standard data sets (TREC 2009 and 2010) demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5176/5114,contextual anchor text representation; anchor graph regularization; quadratic convex optimization
4,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Querying Linked Ontological Data through Distributed Summarization,"Achille Fokoue, Felipe Meneguzzi, Murat Sensoy, Jeff Z. Pan","As the semantic web expands, ontological data becomes distributed over a large network of data sources on the Web. Consequently, evaluating queries that aim to tap into this distributed semantic database necessitates the ability to consult multiple data sources efficiently. In this paper, we propose methods and heuristics to efficiently query distributed ontological data based on a series of properties of summarized data. In our approach, each source summarizes its data as another RDF graph, and relevant section of these summaries are merged and analyzed at query evaluation time. We show how the analysis of these summaries enables more efficient source selection, query pruning and transformation of expensive distributed joins into local joins.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5110/5115,Linked Data; Distributed Reasoning; Distributed Query Answering; SPARQL; OWL; OWL QL
5,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Quality Expectation-Variance Tradeoffs in Crowdsourcing Contests,"Xi Alice Gao, Yoram Bachrach, Peter Key, Thore Graepel","We examine designs for crowdsourcing contests, where participants compete for rewards given to superior solutions of a task. We theoretically analyze tradeoffs between the expectation and variance of the principal's utility (i.e. the best solution's quality), and empirically test our theoretical predictions using a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our evaluation method is also crowdsourcing based and relies on the peer prediction mechanism.  Our theoretical analysis shows an expectation-variance tradeoff of the principal's utility in such contests through a Pareto efficient frontier.  In particular, we show that the simple contest with 2 authors and the 2-pair contest have good theoretical properties. In contrast, our empirical results show that the 2-pair contest is the superior design among all designs tested, achieving the highest expectation and lowest variance of the principal's utility.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4746/5116,crowdsourcing contest; all-pay auction; expectation-variance tradeoff; peer prediction
6,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Online Task Assignment in Crowdsourcing Markets,"Chien-Ju Ho, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan","We explore the problem of assigning heterogeneous tasks to workers with different, unknown skill sets in crowdsourcing markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. We first formalize the online task assignment problem, in which a requester has a fixed set of tasks and a budget that specifies how many times he would like each task completed. Workers arrive one at a time (with the same worker potentially arriving multiple times), and must be assigned to a task upon arrival. The goal is to allocate workers to tasks in a way that maximizes the total benefit that the requester obtains from the completed work. Inspired by recent research on the online adwords problem, we present a two-phase exploration-exploitation assignment algorithm and prove that it is competitive with respect to the optimal offline algorithm which has access to the unknown skill levels of each worker. We empirically evaluate this algorithm using data collected on Mechanical Turk and show that it performs better than random assignment or greedy algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first work to extend the online primal-dual technique used in the online adwords problem to a scenario with unknown parameters, and the first to offer an empirical validation of an online primal-dual algorithm.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5125/5117,Crowdsourcing Markets
7,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Music-Inspired Texture Representation,"Ben Horsburgh, Susan Craw, Stewart Massie","Techniques for music recommendation are increasingly relying on hybrid representations to retrieve new and exciting music. A key component of these representations is musical content, with texture being the most widely used feature. Current techniques for representing texture however are inspired by speech, not music, therefore music representations are not capturing the correct nature of musical texture. In this paper we investigate two parts of the well-established mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) representation: the resolution of mel-frequencies related to the resolution of musical notes; and how best to describe the shape of texture. Through contextualizing these parts, and their relationship to music, a novel music-inspired texture representation is developed. We evaluate this new texture representation by applying it to the task of music recommendation. We use the representation to build three recommendation models, based on current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that by understanding two key parts of texture representation, it is possible to achieve a significant recommendation improvement. This contribution of a music-inspired texture representation will not only improve content-based representation, but will allow hybrid systems to take advantage of a stronger content component.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5041/5118,Web-based recommendation systems; AI for multimedia and multimodal web applications
8,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,ET-LDA: Joint Topic Modeling for Aligning Events and their Twitter Feedback,"Yuheng Hu, Ajita John, Fei Wang, Subbarao Kambhampati","During broadcast events such as the Superbowl, the U.S. Presidential and Primary debates, etc., Twitter has become the de facto platform for crowds to share perspectives and commentaries about them. Given an event and an associated large-scale collection of tweets, there are two fundamental research problems that have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One is to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified framework. We evaluate the proposed model both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4920/5119,"LDA, ET-LDA, Twitter, Tweets, Social Media, Social Netowrks, Social Computing, Event, Events, Public Event, Public Events, Topic Modeling, Machine Learning, Bayesian Learning"
9,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Predictive Mining of Comparable Entities from the Web,"Myungha Jang, Jin-woo Park, Seung-won Hwang","Comparing entities is an important part of decision making. Several approaches have been reported for mining comparable entities from Web sources to improve user experience in comparing entities online.However, these efforts extract only entities explicitly compared in the corpora, and may exclude entities that occur less-frequently but potentially comparable. To build a more complete comparison machine that can infer such missing relations, here we develop a solutionto predict transitivity of known comparable relations. Named CliqueGrow, our approach predicts missing links given a comparable entity graph obtained from versus query logs. Our approach achieved the highest F1-score among five link prediction approaches and a commercial comparison engine provided by Yahoo!.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4981/5120,
10,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,A Convex Formulation for Learning from Crowds,"Hiroshi Kajino, Yuta Tsuboi, Hisashi Kashima","Recently crowdsourcing services are often used to collect a large amount of labeled data for machine learning, since they provide us an easy way to get labels at very low cost and in a short period. The use of crowdsourcing has introduced a new challenge in machine learning, that is, coping with the variable quality of crowd-generated data. Although there have been many recent attempts to address the quality problem of multiple workers, only a few of the existing methods consider the problem of learning classifiers directly from such noisy data. All these methods modeled the true labels as latent variables, which resulted in non-convex optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a convex optimization formulation for learning from crowds without estimating the true labels by introducing personal models of the individual crowd workers. We also devise an efficient iterative method for solving the convex optimization problems by exploiting conditional independence structures in multiple classifiers. We evaluate the proposed method against three competing methods on synthetic data sets and a real crowdsourced data set and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other three methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4919/5121,Crowdsourcing; Convex Formulation; Machine Learning
11,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Diagnosing Changes in An Ontology Stream: A DL Reasoning Approach,Freddy Lecue,"Recently, ontology stream reasoning has been introduced as a multidisciplinary approach, merging synergies from Artificial Intelligence, Database and World-Wide-Web to reason on semantics-augmented data streams, thus a way to answering questions on real time events. However existing approaches do not consider stream change diagnosis i.e., identification of the nature and cause of changes, where explaining the logical connection of knowledge and inferring insight on time changing events are the main challenges. We exploit the Description Logics (DL)-based semantics of streams to tackle these challenges. Based on an analysis of stream behavior through change and inconsistency over DL axioms, we tackled change diagnosis by determining and constructing a comprehensive view on potential causes of inconsistencies. We report a large-scale evaluation of our approach in the context of live stream data from Dublin City Council.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4988/5122,semantic web; ontology stream; stream reasoning; diagnosis; description logics; knowledge discovery
12,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Dynamically Switching between Synergistic Workﬂows for Crowdsourcing,"Christopher H. Lin, Mausam Mausam, Daniel S. Weld","To ensure quality results from unreliable crowdsourced workers, task designers often construct complex workflows and aggregate worker responses from redundant runs. Frequently, they experiment with several alternative workflows to accomplish the task, and eventually deploy the one that achieves the best performance during early trials. Surprisingly, this seemingly natural design paradigm does not achieve the full potential of crowdsourcing. In particular, using a single workflow (even the best) to accomplish a task is suboptimal. We show that alternative workflows can compose synergistically to yield much higher quality output. We formalize the insight with a novel probabilistic graphical model. Based on this model, we design and implement AGENTHUNT, a POMDP-based controller that dynamically switches between these workflows to achieve higher returns on investment. Additionally, we design offline and online methods for learning model parameters. Live experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate the superiority of AGENTHUNT for the task of generating NLP training data, yielding up to 50% error reduction and greater net utility compared to previous methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5129/5123,Decision Theory; Machine Learning; Crowdsourcing
13,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Fine-Grained Entity Recognition,"Xiao Ling, Daniel S. Weld","Entity Recognition (ER) is a key component of relation extraction systems and many other natural-language processing applications. Unfortunately, most ER systems are restricted to produce labels from to a small set of entity classes, e.g., person, organization, location or miscellaneous. In order to intelligently understand text and extract a wide range of information, it is useful to more precisely determine the semantic classes of entities mentioned in unstructured text. This paper defines a fine-grained set of 112 tags, formulates the tagging problem as multi-class, multi-label classification, describes an unsupervised method for collecting training data, and presents the FIGER implementation. Experiments show that the system accurately predicts the tags for entities. Moreover, it provides useful information for a relation extraction system, increasing the F1 score by 93%. We make FIGER and its data available as a resource for future work.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5152/5124,"Named Entity Recognition, information extraction, natural language processing, fine-grained entity recognition"
14,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Social Context-Aware Trust Network Discovery in Complex Contextual Social Networks,"Guanfeng Liu, Yan Wang, Mehmet A Orgun","Trust is one of the most important factors for participants' decision-making in Online Social Networks (OSNs). The trust network from a source to a target without any prior interaction contains some important intermediate participants, the trust relations between the participants, and the social context, each of which has an important influence on trust evaluation. Thus, before performing any trust evaluation, the contextual trust network from a given source to a target needs to be extracted first, where constraints on the social context should also be considered to guarantee the quality of extracted networks. However, this problem has been proved to be NP-Complete. Towards solving this challenging problem, we first propose a complex contextual social network structure which considers social contextual impact factors. These factors have significant influences on both social interaction between participants and trust evaluation. Then, we propose a new concept called QoTN (Quality of Trust Network) and a social context-aware trust network discovery model. Finally, we propose a Social Context-Aware trust Network discovery algorithm (SCAN) by adopting the Monte Carlo method and our proposed optimization strategies. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed model and algorithm outperform the existing methods in both algorithm efficiency and the quality of the extracted trust network.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5037/5125,social network; trust; network discovery
15,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,BabelRelate! A Joint Multilingual Approach to Computing Semantic Relatedness,"Roberto Navigli, Simone Paolo Ponzetto","We present a knowledge-rich approach to computing semantic relatedness which exploits the joint contribution of different languages. Our approach is based on the lexicon and semantic knowledge of a wide-coverage multilingual knowledge base, which is used to compute semantic graphs in a variety of languages. Complementary information from these graphs is then combined to produce a 'core' graph where disambiguated translations are connected by means of strong semantic relations. We evaluate our approach on standard monolingual and bilingual datasets, and show that: i) we outperform a graph-based approach which does not use multilinguality in a joint way; ii) we achieve uniformly competitive results for both resource-rich and resource-poor languages.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5112/5126,Semantic Networks; Multilinguality; Semantic Relatedness
16,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Multinomial Relation Prediction in Social Data: A Dimension Reduction Approach,"Nozomi Nori, Danushka Bollegala, Hisashi Kashima","The recent popularization of social web services has made them one of the primary uses of the World Wide Web. An important concept in social web services is social actions such as making connections and communicating with others and adding annotations to web resources. Predicting social actions would improve many fundamental web applications, such as recommendations and web searches. One remarkable characteristic of social actions is that they involve multiple and heterogeneous objects such as users, documents, keywords, and locations. However, the high-dimensional property of such multinomial relations poses one fundamental challenge, that is, predicting multinomial relations with only a limited amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new multinomial relation prediction method, which is robust to data sparsity. We transform each instance of a multinomial relation into a set of binomial relations between the objects and the multinomial relation of the involved objects. We then apply an extension of a low-dimensional embedding technique to these binomial relations, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem guaranteeing global optimal solutions. We also incorporate attribute information as side information to address the “cold start” problem in multinomial relation prediction. Experiments with various real-world social web service datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust against data sparseness as compared to several existing methods, which can only find sub-optimal solutions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4971/5127,multinomial relation prediction; tensors; social media
17,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Adaptive Polling for Information Aggregation,"Thomas Pfeiffer, Xi Alice Gao, Yiling Chen, Andrew Mao, David G. Rand","The flourishing of online labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) makes it easy to recruit many workers for solving small tasks. We study whether information elicitation and aggregation over a combinatorial space can be achieved by integrating small pieces of potentially imprecise information, gathered from a large number of workers through simple, one-shot interactions in an online labor market. We consider the setting of predicting the ranking of $n$ competing candidates, each having a hidden underlying strength parameter. At each step, our method estimates the strength parameters from the collected pairwise comparison data and adaptively chooses another pairwise comparison question for the next recruited worker. Through an MTurk experiment, we show that the adaptive method effectively elicits and aggregates information, outperforming a naive method using a random pairwise comparison question at each step.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4747/5128,crowdsourcing; information aggregation; ranking; prediction; active learning
18,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,REWOrD: Semantic Relatedness in the Web of Data,Giuseppe Pirró,"This paper presents REWOrD, an approach to compute semantic relatedness between entities in the Web of Data representing real word concepts. REWOrD exploits the graph nature of RDF data and the SPARQL query language to access this data. Through simple queries, REWOrD constructs weighted vectors keeping the informativeness of RDF predicates used to make statements about the entities being compared. The most informative path is also considered to further refine informativeness. Relatedness is then computed by the cosine of the weighted vectors. Differently from previous approaches based on Wikipedia, REWOrD does not require any prepro- cessing or custom data transformation. Indeed, it can lever- age whatever RDF knowledge base as a source of background knowledge. We evaluated REWOrD in different settings by using a new dataset of real word entities and investigate its flexibility. As compared to related work on classical datasets, REWOrD obtains comparable results while, on one side, it avoids the burden of preprocessing and data transformation and, on the other side, it provides more flexibility and applicability in a broad range of domains.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4923/5129,"Relatedness, Web of Data, SPARQL"

While previous work has focused on predicting aggregate properties, such as the prevalence of seasonal influenza in a given country, we consider the task of fine-grained prediction of the health of specific people from noisy and incomplete data. We construct a probabilistic model that can predict if and when an individual will fall ill with high precision and good recall on the basis of his social ties and co-locations with other people, as revealed by their Twitter posts. Our model is highly scalable and can be used to predict general dynamic properties of individuals in large real-world social networks.

20,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,A Mouse-Trajectory Based Model for Predicting Query-URL Relevance,"Song Hengjie, Ruoxue Liao, Xiangliang Zhang, Chunyan Miao, Qiang Yang","For the learning-to-ranking algorithms used in commercial search engines, a conventional way to generate the training examples is to employ professional annotators to label the relevance of query-url pairs. Since label quality depends on the expertise of annotators to a large extent, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Automatically generating labels from click-through data has been well studied to have comparable or better performance than human judges. Click-through data present users’ action and imply their satisfaction on search results, but exclude the interactions between users and search results beyond the page-view level (e.g., eye and mouse movements). This paper proposes a novel approach to comprehensively consider the information underlying mouse trajectory and click-through data so as to describe user behaviors more objectively and achieve a better understanding of the user experience. By integrating multi-sources data, the proposed approach reveals that the relevance labels of query-url pairs are related to positions of urls and users’ behavioral features. Based on their correlations, query-url pairs can be labeled more accurately and search results are more satisfactory to users. The experiments that are conducted on the most popular Chinese commercial search engine (Baidu) validated the rationality of our research motivation and proved that the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4968/5131,
21,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Improved Convergence of Iterative Ontology Alignment using Block-Coordinate Descent,"Uthayasanker Thayasivam, Prashant Doshi","A wealth of ontologies, many of which overlap in their scope, has made aligning ontologies an important problem for the semantic Web. Consequently, several algorithms now exist for automatically aligning ontologies, with mixed success in their performances. Crucial challenges for these algorithms involve scaling to large ontologies, and as applications of ontology alignment evolve, performing the alignment in a reasonable amount of time without compromising on the quality of the alignment. A class of alignment algorithms is iterative and often consumes more time than others while delivering solutions of high quality. We present a novel and general approach for speeding up the multivariable optimization process utilized by these algorithms. Specifically, we use the technique of block-coordinate descent in order to possibly improve the speed of convergence of the iterative alignment techniques. We integrate this approach into three well-known alignment systems and show that the enhanced systems generate similar or improved alignments in significantly less time on a comprehensive testbed of ontology pairs. This represents an important step toward making alignment techniques computationally more feasible.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4914/5132,ontology alignment; iterative approaches; convergence; time
22,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Ontological Smoothing for Relation Extraction with Minimal Supervision,"Congle Zhang, Raphael Hoffmann, Daniel Sabey Weld","Relation extraction, the process of converting natural language text into structured knowledge, is increasingly important. Most successful techniques use supervised machine learning to generate extractors from sentences that have been manually labeled with the relations' arguments. Unfortunately, these methods require numerous training examples, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. This paper presents ontological smoothing, a semi-supervisedtechnique that learns extractors for a set of minimally-labeledrelations. Ontological smoothing has three phases. First, itgenerates a mapping between the target relations and a backgroundknowledge-base. Second, it uses distant supervision toheuristically generate new training examples for the targetrelations. Finally, it learns an extractor from a combination of theoriginal and newly-generated examples. Experiments on 65 relationsacross three target domains show that ontological smoothing candramatically improve precision and recall, even rivaling fully supervisedperformance in many cases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4837/5133,relation extraction; distant supervised learning; ontology mapping
23,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,A Data-Driven Approach to Question Subjectivity Identification in Community Question Answering,"Tom Chao Zhou, Xiance Si, Edward Y. Chang, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu","Automatic Subjective Question Answering (ASQA), which aims at answering users'subjective questions using summaries of multiple opinions, becomes increasingly important. One challenge of ASQA is that expected answers for subjective questions may not readily exist in the Web. The rising and popularity of Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, which provide platforms for people to post and answer questions, provides an alternative to ASQA. One important task of ASQA is question subjectivity identification, which identifies whether a user is asking a subjective question. Unfortunately, there has been little labeled training data available for this task. In this paper, we propose an approach to collect training data automatically by utilizing social signals in CQA sites without involving any manual labeling. Experimental results show that our data-driven approach achieves 9.37% relative improvement over the supervised approach using manually labeled data, and achieves 5.15% relative gain over a state-of-the-art semi-supervised approach. In addition, we propose several heuristic features for question subjectivity identification. By adding these features, we achieve 11.23% relative improvement over word n-gram feature under the same experimental setting.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4976/5134,Community Question Answering; Question Classification; Data Driven Approach; Social Signal
24,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Discovering Spammers in Social Networks,"Yin Zhu, Xiao Wang, Erheng Zhong, Nathan N. Liu, He Li, Qiang Yang","As the popularity of the social media increases, as evidenced in Twitter, Facebook and China's Renren, spamming activities also picked up in numbers and variety.  On social network sites, spammers often disguise themselves by creating fake accounts and hijacking normal users' accounts for personal gains. Different from the spammers in traditional systems such as SMS and email, spammers in social media behave like normal users  and they continue to change their spamming strategies to fool anti spamming systems. However, due to the privacy and resource concerns, many social media websites cannot fully monitor all the contents of users, making many of the previous approaches, such as topology-based and content-classification-based methods, infeasible to use.  In this paper, we propose a novel method for spammer detection in social networks that exploits both social activities as well as users' social relations in an innovative and highly scalable manner. The proposed method detects spammers following collective activities based on users' social actions and relations.  We have empirically tested our method on data from Renren.com, which is the largest social network in China, and demonstrated that our new method can improve the detection performance significantly.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5073/5135,
25,2012,Artificial Intelligence and the Web,Towards Automated Choreographing of Web Services Using Planning,"Guobing Zou, Yixin Chen, You Xu, Ruoyun Huang, Yang Xiang","For Web service composition, choreography has recently received great attention and demonstrated a few key advantages over orchestration such as distributed control, fairness, data efficiency, and scalability. Automated design of choreography plans, especially distributed plans for multiple roles, is more complex and has not been studied before. Existing work requires manual generation assisted by model checking. In this paper, we propose a novel planning-based approach that can automatically convert a given composition task to a distributed choreography specification. Although planning has been used for orchestration, it is difficult to use planning for choreography, as it involves decentralized control, concurrent workflows, and contingency. We propose a few novel techniques, including compilation of contingencies, dependency graph analysis, and communication control, to handle these characteristics using planning. We theoretically show the correctness of this approach and empirically evaluate its practicability.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4821/5136,Service choreography; Automated planning; Distributed Choreography
26,2012,Cognitive Systems,Sentic Activation: A Two-Level Affective Common Sense Reasoning Framework,"Erik Cambria, Daniel Olsher, Kenneth Kwok","An important difference between traditional AI systems and human intelligence is our ability to harness common sense knowledge gleaned from a lifetime of learning and experiences to inform our decision making and behavior. This allows humans to adapt easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically for lack of situation-specific rules and generalization capabilities. Common sense knowledge also provides the background knowledge for humans to successfully operate in social situations where such knowledge is typically assumed.

However, for long-lived agents, there are numerous unexplored computational challenges in supporting useful episodic-memory functions while maintaining real-time reactivity. In this paper, we review the implementation of episodic memory in Soar and present an expansive evaluation of that system. We demonstrate useful applications of episodic memory across a variety of domains, including games, mobile robotics, planning, and linguistics.

28,2012,Cognitive Systems,Towards a Cognitive System that Can Recognize Spatial Regions Based on Context,"Nick Hawes, Matthew Klenk, Kate Lockwood, Graham S. Horn, John D Kelleher","In order to collaborate with people in the real world, cognitive systems must be able to represent and reason about spatial regions in human environments. Consider the command ""go to the front of the classroom"". The spatial region mentioned (the front of the classroom) is not perceivable using geometry alone. Instead it is defined by its functional use, implied by nearby objects and their configuration. In this paper, we define such areas as context-dependent spatial regions and present a cognitive system able to learn them by combining qualitative spatial representations, semantic labels, and analogy. The system is capable of generating a collection of qualitative spatial representations describing the configuration of the entities it perceives in the world. It can then be taught context-dependent spatial regions using anchor pointsdefined on these representations.  From this we then demonstrate how an existing computational model of analogy can be used to detect context-dependent spatial regions in previously unseen rooms. To evaluate this process we compare detected regions to annotations made on maps of real rooms by human volunteers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5061/5683,"cognitive systems, qualitative spatial reasoning, robotics"

We claim that qualitative models provide a useful intermediate level of causal representation for dynamic domains, including the formulation of strategies and tactics. We argue that qualitative models are quickly learnable, and enable model-based reasoning techniques to be used to recognize, operationalize, and construct more strategic knowledge. This paper describes an approach to incrementally learning qualitative influences by demonstration in the context of a strategy game. We show how the learned model can help a system play by enabling it to explain which actions could contribute to maximizing a quantitative goal. We also show how reasoning about the model allows it to reformulate a learning problem to address delayed effects and credit assignment, such that it can improve its performance on more strategic tasks such as city placement.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4959/5140,Qualitative Reasoning; Cognitive Systems; Machine Learning

We explore the notion that such future-state generation is more widespread and forms an integral part of cognition. We call these generated states expectations, and propose that cognitive systems constantly generate expectations, match them to observed behavior and react when a difference exists between the two. We describe an ACT-R model that performs expectation-driven cognition on two tasks – pedestrian tracking and behavior classification. The model generates expectations of pedestrian movements to track them. The model also uses differences in expectations to identify distinctive features that differentiate these tracks. During learning, the model learns the association between these features and the various behaviors. During testing, it classifies pedestrian tracks by recalling the behavior associated with the features of each track. We tested the model on both single and multiple behavior datasets and compared the results against a k-NN classifier. The k-NN classifier outperformed the model in correct classifications, but the model had fewer incorrect classifications in the multiple behavior case, and both systems had about equal incorrect classifications in the single behavior case.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5106/5142,Cognitive Architecture; Expectation-driven Cognition

We present an approach for computing both context-dependent and context- independent recognition judgments using processes and data shared with declarative memories.

34,2012,Cognitive Systems,Social Cognition: Memory Decay and Adaptive Information Filtering for Robust Information Maintenance,"David Reitter, Christian Lebiere","Two information decay methods are examined that help multi-agent systems cope with dynamic environments.  The agents in this simulation have human-like memory and a mechanism to moderate their communications: they forget internally stored information via temporal decay, and they forget distributed information by filtering it as it passes through a communication network.  The agents play a foraging game, in which performance depends on communicating facts and requests and on storing facts in internal memory.  Parameters of the game and agent models are tuned to human data.  Agent groups with moderated communication in small-world networks achieve optimal performance for typical human memory decay values, while non-adaptive agents benefit from stronger memory decay. The decay and filtering strategies interact with the properties of the network graph in ways suggestive of an evolutionary co-optimization between the human cognitive system and an external social structure.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5097/5145,memory and knowledge; natural language processing; dialogue and interaction

Using case-based reasoning and an author level planning system, Minstrel models human creative processes. However, the algorithmic and representational commitments made in Minstrel were never subject to principled and quantitative analysis. By rationally reconstructing Minstrel, we are able to investigate Turner's computational model of creativity and learn new lessons about his architecture. We find that Minstrel's original performance was tied to a well-groomed case library, but by modifying several components of the algorithm we can create a more general version which can construct stories using a sparser and less structured case library. Through a rational reconstruction of Minstrel, we both learn new architectural and algorithmic lessons about Minstrel’s computational model of creativity as well as make his architecture available to the contemporary research community for further experimentation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5161/5146,interactive storytelling; procedural story generation

Given urban population growth, and that the amount of waste generated by each of us citizens is also growing, the total amount of waste to be collected and treated is growing dramatically (EPA 2011), becoming one sensitive issue for local governments. A modern technique for waste collection that is steadily being adopted is automated vacuum waste collection. This technology uses air suction on a closed network of underground pipes to move waste from the collection points to the processing station, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as inconveniences to citizens (odors, noise, . . . ) and allowing better waste reuse and recycling. This technique is open to optimize energy consumption because moving huge amounts of waste by air impulsion requires a lot of electric power.

Martin, Samuel Nicol, Regis Sabbadin, Olivier Buffet","In conservation biology and natural resource management, adaptive management is an iterative process of improving management by reducing uncertainty via monitoring. Adaptive management is the principal tool for conserving endangered species under global change, yet adaptive management problems suffer from a poor suite of solution methods. The common approach used to solve an adaptive management problem is to assume the system state is known and the system dynamics can be one of a set of pre-defined models. The solution method used is unsatisfactory, employing value iteration on a discretized belief MDP which restricts the study to very small problems. We show how to overcome this limitation by modelling an adaptive management problem as a restricted Mixed Observability MDP called hidden model MDP (hmMDP). We demonstrate how to simplify the value function, the backup operator and the belief update computation. We show that, although a simplified case of POMDPs, hm-MDPs are PSPACE-complete in the finite-horizon case. We illustrate the use of this model to manage a population of the threatened Gouldian finch, a bird species endemic to Northern Australia.

In addition to dominating the ocean's kinetic energy, eddies play a significant role in the transport of water, salt, heat, and nutrients. Therefore, understanding current and future eddy patterns is a central climate challenge to address future sustainability of marine ecosystems. The emergence of sea surface height observations from satellite radar altimeter has recently enabled researchers to track eddies at a global scale. The majority of studies that identify eddies from observational data employ highly parametrized connected component algorithms using expert filtered data, effectively making reproducibility and scalability challenging. In this paper, we frame the challenge of monitoring ocean eddies as an unsupervised learning problem. We present a novel change detection algorithm that automatically identifies and monitors eddies in sea surface height data based on heuristics derived from basic eddy properties.

With a limited budget, officials will try to distribute the patrols throughout the forest intelligently, in order to most effectively limit extraction. Prior work in forest economics has formalized this as a Stackelberg game, one very different in character from the discrete Stackelberg problem settings previously studied in the multiagent literature. Specifically, the leader wishes to minimize the distance by which a profit-maximizing extractor will trespass into the forest---or to maximize the radius of the remaining ``pristine'' forest area. The follower's cost-benefit analysis of potential trespass distances is affected by the likelihood of being caught and suffering confiscation. In this paper, we give a near-optimal patrol allocation algorithm and a 1/2-approximation algorithm, the latter of which is more efficient and yields simpler, more practical patrol allocations.

Unfortunately, it also presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability: it is a temporal, large-scale prediction task, e.g., when monitoring plants over time using hyperspectral imaging, and features are `things' with a `biological' meaning and interpretation and not just mathematical abstractions computable for any data. In this paper we propose Dirichlet-aggregation regression (DAR) to meet the challenge. DAR represents all data by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time and easy to interpret.Then, it puts a Gaussian process prior on the Dirichlet distributions induced on the simplex spanned by the extremes. The prior can be a function of any observed meta feature such as time, location, type of fertilization, and plant species. We evaluated DAR on two hyperspectral image series of plants over time with about 2 (resp. 5.8) Billion matrix entries.

This problem can be solved by standard integer programming methods using the sample average approximation (SAA) scheme. Our main contribution lies in exploiting the separable structure present in this problem and using Lagrangian relaxation techniques to gain scalability over the flat representation. We also generalize the approach to allow the application of the SAA scheme to a range of stochastic optimization problems. Our iterative approach is highly efficient in terms of space requirements and it provides an upper bound over the optimal solution at each iteration.

In this paper we propose an approach by which individual appliances can be iteratively separated from an aggregate load. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it assume complete knowledge of the appliances present in the household. Instead, we propose an approach in which prior models of general appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures extracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are then used to estimate each appliance's load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load. This process is applied iteratively until all appliances for which prior behaviour models are known have been disaggregated. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach using the REDD data set, and show the disaggregation performance when using our training approach is comparable to when sub-metered training data is used.

In particular, we design a payment mechanism that encourages DERs to join CVPPs with large overall production. Our method is based on strictly proper scoring rules and incentivises the provision of accurate predictions from the CVPPs---and in turn, the member DERs---which aids in the planning of the supply schedule at the Grid.

54,2012,Computational Sustainability and Artificial Intelligence,Robust Cuts Over Time: Combatting the Spread of Invasive Species with Unreliable Biological Control,Gwen Spencer,"Widespread accounts of the harmful effects of invasive species have stimulated both practical and theoretical studies on how the spread of these destructive agents can be contained. In practice, a widely used method is the deployment of biological control agents, that is, the release of an additional species (which may also spread) that creates a hostile environment for the invader. Seeding colonies of these protective biological control agents can be used to build a kind of living barrier against the spread of the harmful invader, but the ecological literature documents that attempts to establish colonies of biological control agents often fail (opening gaps in the barrier). Further, the supply of the protective species is limited, and the full supply may not be available immediately. This problem has a natural temporal component: biological control is deployed as the extent of the harmful invasion grows. How can a limited supply of unreliable biological control agents best be deployed over time to protect the landscape against the spread of a harmful invasive species? To explore this question we introduce a new family of stochastic graph vaccination problems that generalizes ideas from social networks and multistage graph vaccination. We point out a deterministic (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm for a deterministic base case studied in the social networks literature (matching the previous best randomized (1 -1/e) guarantee for that problem). Next, we show that the randomized (1 -1/e) guarantee (and a deterministic 1/2 guarantee) can be extended to our much more general family of stochastic graph vaccination problems in which vaccinations (a.k.a. biological control colonies) spread but may be unreliable. For the non-spreading vaccination case with unreliable vaccines, we give matching results in trees. Qualitatively, our extension is from computing “cuts over time” to computing “robust cuts over time.” Our new family of problems captures the key tensions we identify for containing invasive species spread with unreliable biological control agents: a robust barrier is built over time with unreliable resources to contain an expanding invasion.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4900/5166,Optimization; Cut; Graphs; Stochastic; Sustainability; Invasive; Connection; Networks

Current solutions consider several factors such as the charge of the battery and how efficient the engine operates at a given speed.  Previous research has shown that by taking into account the future power requirements of the vehicle, a more efficient balance of engine vs. battery power can be attained. In this paper, we utilize a probabilistic driving route prediction system, trained using Inverse Reinforcement Learning, to optimize the hybrid control policy. Our approach considers routes that the driver is likely to be taking, computing an optimal mix of engine and battery power. This approach has the potential to increase vehicle power efficiency while not requiring any hardware modification or change in driver behavior.

We develop the problem formally as a stochastic optimization problem over a network cascade model describing the population spread, and present a solution approach that reduces the stochastic problem to a novel variant of a Steiner tree problem. We give a primal-dual algorithm for the problem that computes both a feasible solution and a bound on the quality of an optimal solution.

We take a simulation-based approach, where the utility of an allocation is measured by directly simulating emergency requests. In both the static and dynamic settings, this modeling approach leads to an exponentially large action space (with respect to the number of ambulances). Futhermore, the utility of any particular allocation can only be measured via a seemingly “black box” simulator. Despite this complexity, we show that embedding our simulator within a simple and efficient greedy allocation algorithm produces good solutions. We derive data-driven performance guarantees which yield small optimality gap. Given its efficiency, we can repeatedly employ this approach in real-time for dynamic repositioning. We conduct simulation experiments based on real usage data of an EMS system from a large Asian city, and demonstrate significant improvement in the system’s service levels using static allocations and redeployment policies discovered by our approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5148/5169,

This is typically the case for systems under the control of an on-line policy: even when the policy itself is well known, capturing its effect on the system in a declarative model is often impossible by conventional means. Such a difficulty is at the root of the classical, sharp separation between off- line and on-line approaches. In this paper, we investigate a general method to model controlled systems, based on the integration of Machine Learning and Constraint Programming (CP). Specifically, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to learn the behavior of a controlled system (a multicore CPU with thermal con- trollers) and plug it into a CP model by means of Neuron Constraints. The method obtains significantly better results compared to an approach with no ANN guidance. Neuron Constraints were first introduced in [Bartolini et al., 2011b] as a mean to model complex systems: providing evidence of their applicability to controlled systems is a significant step forward, broadening the application field of combinatorial methods and disclosing opportunities for hybrid off-line/on-line optimization.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5042/5220,Modeling Complex Systems; Thermal Aware Workload Dispatching; Modeling Controlled Systems; Neuron Constraints

To address these drawbacks, we propose two new strategies: two stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to be exchanged separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically.

Modern infrastructures feature complex cyclic interdependencies and require a holistic restoration process.  This paper presents the first scalable approach for the last-mile restoration of the joint electrical power and gas infrastructures. It builds on an earlier three-stage decomposition for restoring the power network that decouples the  restoration ordering and the routing aspects. The key contributions  of the paper are (1) mixed-integer programming models for finding a minimal restoration set and a restoration ordering and (2) a randomized adaptive decomposition to obtain high-quality solutions  within the required time constraints.

But, A* may generate many extra nodes which are never expanded. This is a performance loss, especially when the branching factor is large. Partial Expansion A* addresses this problem when expanding a node, n, by generating all the children of n but only storing children with the same f-cost as n. n is re-inserted into the OPEN list, but with the f-cost of the next best child. This paper introduces an enhanced version of PEA* (EPEA*). Given a priori domain knowledge, EPEA* generates only the children with the same f-cost as the parent. EPEA* is generalized to its iterative-deepening variant, EPE-IDA*. For some domains, these algorithms yield substantial performance improvements.

This requires a new perspective in the design and evaluation of parallel search algorithms. Previous work in parallel search implicitly assumed ownership of a cluster with a static amount of CPU cores and RAM, and emphasized wallclock runtime. With utility computing resources, trade-offs between performance and monetary costs must be considered. This paper considers dynamically increasing the usage of utility computing resources until a problem is solved. Efficient resource allocation policies are analyzed in comparison with an optimal allocation strategy. We evaluate our iterative allocation strategy by applying it to the HDA* parallel search algorithm. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions. They show that, in practice, the costs incurred by iterative allocation are reasonably close to an optimal (but a priori unknown) policy, and are significantly better than the worst-case analytical bounds.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5054/5227,parallel search; heuristic search; cloud computing

Several local search algorithms are based on searching the k-exchange neighborhood. This is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most k elements. As a rule of thumb, the larger k is, the better are the chances of finding an improved solution. However, for inputs of size n, a naive brute-force search of the k-exchange neighborhood requires n(O(k)) time, which is not practical even for very small values of k. Fellows et al. (IJCAI 2009) studied whether this brute-force search is avoidable and gave positive and negative answers for several combinatorial problems. They used the notion of local search in a strict sense. That is, an improved solution needs to be found in the k-exchange neighborhood even if a global optimum can be found efficiently. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of local search, called permissive local search (Marx and Schlotter, IWPEC 2009) and investigate whether it enhances the domain of tractable inputs. We exemplify this approach on a fundamental combinatorial problem, Vertex Cover. More precisely, we show that for a class of inputs, finding an optimum is hard, strict local search is hard, but permissive local search is tractable.

Since projections/extensions modify the cost functions, an important issue is tractable projection-safety, concerning whether minimum cost computation remains tractable after projections/extensions. In this paper, we prove that tractable projection-safety is always possible for projections/extensions to/from the nullary cost function (W0), and always impossible for projections/extensions to/from n-ary cost functions for n > = 2.  When n = 1, the answer is indefinite.  We give a simple negative example, while Lee and Leung's flow-based projection-safe cost functions are also tractable projection-safe.

However, search differs from MAB in that in MCTS it is usually only the final ``arm pull'' (the actual move selection) that collects a reward, rather than all ``arm pulls''. Therefore, it makes more sense to minimize the simple regret, as opposed to the cumulative regret. We begin by introducing policies for multi-armed bandits with lower finite-time and asymptotic simple regret than UCB, using it to develop a two-stage scheme (SR+CR) for MCTS which outperforms UCT empirically. Optimizing the sampling process is itself a metareasoning problem, a solution of which can use value of information (VOI) techniques. Although the theory of VOI for search exists, applying it to MCTS is non-trivial, as typical myopic assumptions fail.

Hoos, Kevin Leyton-Brown","Uniform random 3-SAT at the solubility phase transition is one of the most widely studied and empirically hardest distributions of SAT instances. For 20 years, this distribution has been used extensively for evaluating and comparing algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that simple rules can predict the solubility of these instances with surprisingly high accuracy. Specifically, we show how classification accuracies of about 70% can be obtained based on cheaply (polynomial-time) computable features on a wide range of instance sizes. We argue in two ways that classification accuracy does not decrease with instance size: first, we show that our models' predictive accuracy remains roughly constant across a wide range of problem sizes; second, we show that a classifier trained on small instances is sufficient to achieve very accurate predictions across the entire range of instance sizes currently solvable by complete methods. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple decision tree based on only two features, and again trained only on the smallest instances, achieves predictive accuracies close to those of our most complex model. We conjecture that this two-feature model outperforms random guessing asymptotically; due to the model's extreme simplicity, we believe that this conjecture is a worthwhile direction for future theoretical work.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5098/5242,Random 3-SAT; Phase Transition; Classification
84,2012,Knowledge-Based Information Systems,Time-Critical Influence Maximization in Social Networks with Time-Delayed Diffusion Process,"Wei Chen, Wei Lu, Ning Zhang","Influence maximization is a problem of finding a small set of highly influential users in a social network such that the spread of influence under certain propagation models is maximized. In this paper, we consider time-critical influence maximization, in which one wants to maximize influence spread within a given deadline. Since timing is considered in the optimization, we also extend the Independent Cascade (IC) model to incorporate the time delay aspect of influence diffusion in social networks. We show that time-critical influence maximization under the time-delayed IC model maintains desired properties such as submodularity, which allows a greedy algorithm to achieve an approximation ratio of 1-1/e, to circumvent the NP-hardness of the problem. To overcome the inefficiency of the approximation algorithm, we design two heuristic algorithms: the first one is based on a dynamic programming procedure that computes exact influence in tree structures, while the second one converts the problem to one in the original IC model and then applies existing fast heuristics to it. Our simulation results demonstrate that our heuristics achieve the same level of influence spread as the greedy algorithm while running a few orders of magnitude faster, and they also outperform existing algorithms that disregard the deadline constraint and delays in diffusion.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5024/5243,Social Networks; Influence Maximization; Information Diffusion

In order to explore, retrieve, and reuse that data, tables should be identified and the data extracted. Table recognition is an old field of research. However, due to the diversity of table styles, the results are still far from satisfactory, and not a single algorithm performs well on all different types of tables. In this paper, we randomly take samples from the CiteSeerX to investigate diverse table styles for automatic table extraction. We find that table headers are one of the main characteristics of complex table styles. We identify a set of features that can be used to segregate headers from tabular data and build a classifier to detect table headers. Our empirical evaluation on PDF documents shows that using a Random Forest classifier achieves an accuracy of 92%.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5046/5244,table header detection; table classification; table extraction

Previous attempts for this task mostly rely on visual clues and corpus statistics, but do not take much advantage of the semantic information inherent in the available image descriptions. Here, we present a generic method which benefits from all these three sources (i.e. visual clues, corpus statistics and available descriptions) simultaneously, and is capable of constructing novel descriptions. Our approach works on syntactically and linguistically motivated phrases extracted from the human descriptions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our formulation mostly generates lucid and semantically correct descriptions, and significantly outperforms the previous methods on automatic evaluation metrics. One of the significant advantages of our approach is that we can generate multiple interesting descriptions for an image.

Traditionally, document summarization is implemented by extracting sentences that cover the main topics of a document with a minimum redundancy. In this paper, we take a different perspective from data reconstruction and propose a novel framework named Document Summarization based on Data Reconstruction (DSDR). Specifically, our approach generates a summary which consist of those sentences that can best reconstruct the original document. To model the relationship among sentences, we introduce two objective functions: (1) linear reconstruction, which approximates the document by linear combinations of the selected sentences; (2) nonnegative linear reconstruction, which allows only additive, not subtractive, linear combinations. In this framework, the reconstruction error becomes a natural criterion for measuring the quality of the summary. For each objective function, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem.

Unified messaging system provides a single interface for users to receive and process information from multiple sources. It is highly desirable to design attention management solution that can help users easily navigate and process dozens of unread messages from a unified message system. Moreover, with the proliferation of mobile devices people are now selectively consuming the most important messages on the go between different activities in their daily life. The information overload problem is especially acute for mobile users with small screen to display. In this paper, we present \PAM, an intelligent end-to-end Personalized Attention Management solution that employs analytical techniques that can learn user interests and organize and prioritize incoming messages based on user interests. For a list of unread messages, \PAM generates a concise attention report that allows users to quickly scan the important new messages from his important social connections as well as messages about his most important tasks that the user is involved with.

90,2012,Knowledge-Based Information Systems,Double-Bit Quantization for Hashing,"Weihao Kong, Wu-Jun Li","Hashing, which tries to learn similarity-preserving binary codes for data representation, has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive databases due to its fast query speed and low storage cost. Because it is NP hard to directly compute the best binary codes for a given data set, mainstream hashing methods typically adopt a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, several projected dimensions of real values are generated. Then in the second stage, the real values will be quantized into binary codes by thresholding. Currently, most existing methods use one single bit to quantize each projected dimension. One problem with this single-bit quantization (SBQ) is that the threshold typically lies in the region of the highest point density and consequently a lot of neighboring points close to the threshold will be hashed to totally different bits, which is unexpected according to the principle of hashing. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization strategy, called double-bit quantization (DBQ), to solve the problem of SBQ. The basic idea of DBQ is to quantize each projected dimension into double bits with adaptively learned thresholds. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that our DBQ strategy can significantly outperform traditional SBQ strategy for hashing.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5080/5250,

Although many hashing based approaches have been proposed for approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensional space, one main drawback is that they often return many false positives that need to be filtered out by a post procedure. We propose a novel method to address this limitation in this paper. The key idea is to introduce a filtering procedure within the search algorithm, based on the compressed sensing theory, that effectively removes the false positive answers. We first obtain a sparse representation for each data point by the landmark based approach, after which we solve the nearly duplicate search that the difference between the query and its nearest neighbors forms a sparse vector living in a small ℓp ball, where p ≤ 1.

However, a series of conventions allows users to tweet in structural ways using combination of different blocks of texts.These blocks include plain texts, hashtags, links, mentions, etc. Each block encodes a variety of communicative intent and sequence of these blocks captures changing discourse. Previous work shows that exploiting the structural information can improve the structured document (e.g., web pages) retrieval. In this paper we utilize the structure of tweets, induced by these blocks, for Twitter retrieval. A set of features, derived from the blocks of text and their combinations, is used into a learning-to-rank scenario. We show that structuring tweets can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

The matrix completion is to recover a low-rank matrix with a fraction of its entries arbitrarily corrupted. Instead of solving the popularly used trace norm or nuclear norm based objective, we directly minimize the original formulations of trace norm and rank norm. We propose a novel Schatten $p$-Norm optimization framework that unifies different norm formulations. An efficient algorithm is derived to solve the new objective and followed by the rigorous theoretical proof on the convergence. The previous main solution strategy for this problem requires computing singular value decompositions - a task that requires increasingly cost as matrix sizes and rank increase. Our algorithm has closed form solution in each iteration, hence it converges fast. As a consequence, our algorithm has the capacity of solving large-scale matrix completion problems.

Xiang, Qiang Yang","To solve the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering, researchers have introduced transfer learning as a viable approach to make use of auxiliary data.  Most previous transfer learning works in collaborative filtering have focused on exploiting point-wise ratings such as numerical ratings, stars, or binary ratings of likes/dislikes. However, in many real-world recommender systems, many users may be unwilling or unlikely to rate items with precision.In contrast, practitioners can turn to various non-preference data to estimate a range or rating distribution of a user's preference on an item.Such a range or rating distribution is called an uncertain rating since it represents a rating spectrum of uncertainty instead of an accurate point-wise score. In this paper, we propose an efficient transfer learning solution for collaborative filtering, known as {\em transfer by integrative factorization} (TIF), to leverage such auxiliary uncertain ratings to improve the performance of recommendation. In particular, we integrate auxiliary data of uncertain ratings as additional constraints in the target matrix factorization problem, and learn an expected rating value for each uncertain rating automatically. The advantages of our proposed approach include the efficiency and the improved effectiveness of collaborative filtering, showing that incorporating the auxiliary data of uncertain ratings can really bring a benefit. Experimental results on two movie recommendation tasks show that our TIF algorithm performs significantly better over a state-of-the-art non-transfer learning method.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4826/5254,Transfer Learning; Collaborative Filtering

For each iteration, reasoning properties (including number of questions answered and run time) are collected, to explore how learning strategies and reasoning interact.

The rating process is assumed to start from the lowest level, evaluates against the latent utility at the corresponding level and moves up until a suitable ordinal level is found. Crucial to this generative process is the underlying utility random variables that govern the generation of ratings and their modelling choices. To this end, we make a novel use of the generalised extreme value distributions, which is found to be particularly suitable for our modeling tasks and at the same time, facilitate our inference and learning procedure. The proposed approach is flexible to incorporate features from both the user and the item. We evaluate the proposed framework on three well-known datasets: MovieLens, Dating Agency and Netflix.

This paper provides such procedure. It establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target domain are estimable from both the statistical information available and the causal information transferred from the experiments.

Recent work on consistent query answering in the presence of ontologies has shown this problem to be intractable in data complexity even for ontologies expressed in lightweight description logics. In order to better understand the source of this intractability, we investigate the complexity of consistent query answering for simple ontologies consisting only of class subsumption and class disjointness axioms. We show that for conjunctive queries with at most one quantified variable, the problem is first-order expressible; for queries with at most two quantified variables, the problem has polynomial data complexity but may not be first-order expressible; and for three quantified variables, the problem may become co-NP-hard in data complexity. For queries having at most two quantified variables, we further identify a necessary and sufficient condition for first-order expressibility. In order to be able to handle arbitrary conjunctive queries, we propose a novel inconsistency-tolerant semantics and show that under this semantics, first-order expressibility is always guaranteed.

Diagnosability directly depends on the availability of observations, and can be guaranteed by different sets of sensors, possibly associated with different costs. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesizing observability requirements, i.e. automatically discovering a set of observations that is sufficient to guarantee diagnosability. We propose a novel approach with the following characterizing features. First, it fully covers a comprehensive formal framework for diagnosability analysis, and enables ranking configurations of observables in terms of cost, minimality, and diagnosability delay. Second, we propose two complementary algorithms for the synthesis of observables.

This allows for making the intensional level of the ontology as dynamic as traditionally the extensional level is. To do so, we resort to the meta-modeling capabilities of higher-order Description Logics, which allow us to see concepts and roles as individuals, and vice versa. The challenge in this setting is to design tractable query answering algorithms. Besides the definition of MKBs, our main result is that answering instance queries posed to MKBs expressed in Hi(DL-LiteR) can be done efficiently.

Efficient realizations often exploit database technology and rewrite a given query to an equivalent SQL or Datalog query over a database associated with the ontology. This approach has been intensively studied for conjunctive query answering in the DL-Lite and EL families, but is much less explored for more expressive DLs and queries. We present a rewriting-based algorithm for conjunctive query answering over Horn-SHIQ ontologies, possibly extended with recursive rules under limited recursion as in DL+log. This setting not only subsumes both DL-Lite and EL, but also yields an algorithm for answering (limited) recursive queries over Horn-SHIQ ontologies (an undecidable problem for full recursive queries).

Under various goodness-of-fit measures, finding an optimal network is NP-hard, even if restricted to polytrees of bounded in-degree. Polynomial-time algorithms are known only for rare special cases, perhaps most notably for branchings, that is, polytrees in which the in-degree of every node is at most one. Here, we study the complexity of finding an optimal polytree that can be turned into a branching by deleting some number of arcs or nodes, treated as a parameter. We show that the problem can be solved via a matroid intersection formulation in polynomial time if the number of deleted arcs is bounded by a constant. The order of the polynomial time bound depends on this constant, hence the algorithm does not establish fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the number of deleted arcs. We show that a restricted version of the problem allows fixed-parameter tractability and hence scales well with the parameter. We contrast this positive result by showing that if we parameterize by the number of deleted nodes, a somewhat more powerful parameter, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable, subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4927/5266,Bayesian network; Structure learning; Extensions of polytrees

To do so, we generalize Datalog+/- by non-stratified nonmonotonic negation in rule bodies, and we define a WFS for this generalization via guarded fixed-point logic. We refer to this approach as equality-friendly WFS, since it has the advantage that it does not make the unique name assumption (UNA); this brings it close to OWL and its profiles as well as typical DLs, which also do not make the UNA. We prove that for guarded Datalog+/- with negation under the equality-friendly WFS, conjunctive query answering is decidable, and we provide precise complexity results for this problem.

A wide variety of query rewriting algorithms have been proposed in recent years and implemented in highly optimised reasoning systems. Query rewriting systems are complex software programs; even if based on provably correct algorithms, sophisticated optimisations make the systems more complex and errors become more likely to happen. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given an ontology as input, synthetically generates ``relevant'' test queries. Intuitively, each of these queries can be used to verify whether the system correctly performs a certain set of ``inferences'', each of which can be traced back to axioms in the input ontology. Furthermore, we present techniques that allow us to determine whether a system is unsound and/or incomplete for a given test query and ontology. Our evaluation shows that most publicly available query rewriting systems are unsound and/or incomplete, even on commonly used benchmark ontologies; more importantly, our techniques revealed the precise causes of their correctness issues and the systems were then corrected based on our feedback.

113,2012,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,Conflict-Based Belief Revision Operators in Possibilistic Logic,"Guilin Qi, Kewen Wang","In this paper, we investigate belief revision in possibilistic logic, which is a weighted logic proposed to deal with incomplete and uncertain information. Existing revision operators in possibilistic logic are restricted in the sense that the input information can only be a formula instead of a possibilistic knowledge base which is a set of weighted formulas. To break this restriction, we consider weighted prime implicants of a possibilistic knowledge base and use them to define novel revision operators in possibilistic logic. Intuitively, a weighted prime implicant of a possibilistic knowledge base is a logically weakest possibilistic term (i.e., a set of weighted literals) that can entail the knowledge base. We first show that the existing definition of a weighted prime implicant is problematic and need a modification. To define a revision operator using weighted prime implicants, we face two problems. The first problem is that we need to define the notion of a conflict set between two weighted prime implicants of two possibilistic knowledge bases to achieve minimal change. The second problem is that we need to define the disjunction of possibilistic terms. We solve these problems and define two conflict-based revision operators in possibilistic logic. We then adapt the well-known postulates for revision proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon and show that our revision operators satisfy four of the basic adapted postulates and satisfy two others in some special cases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5064/5273,Belief Revision; Possibilistic Logic; Weighted Prime Implicant

In our research, we introduce Concept-Based Disambiguation (CBD), a novel framework that utilizes recent semantic analysis techniques to represent both the context of the word and its senses in a high-dimensional space of natural concepts. The concepts are retrieved from a vast encyclopedic resource, thus enriching the disambiguation process with large amounts of domain-specific knowledge. In such concept-based spaces, more comprehensive measures can be applied in order to pick the right sense. Additionally, we introduce a novel representation scheme, denoted anchored representation, that builds a more specific text representation associated with an anchoring word. We evaluate our framework and show that the anchored representation is more suitable to the task of word-sense disambiguation (WSD). Additionally, we show that our system is superior to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on domain-specific corpora, and competitive with recent methods when evaluated on a general corpus.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4957/5274,natural language processing; web mining; machine learning

However, it was recently observed that the FLP semantics may produce unintuitive answer sets with circular justifications caused by self-supporting loops. In this paper, we address the circular justification problem for general logic programs by enhancing the FLP semantics with a level mapping formalism. In particular, we extend the Gelfond-Lifschitz three step definition of the standard answer set semantics from normal logic programs to general logic programs and define for general logic programs the first FLP semantics that is free of circular justifications. We call this FLP semantics the well-justified FLP semantics. This method naturally extends to general logic programs with additional constraints like aggregates, thus providing a unifying framework for defining the well-justified FLP semantics for various types of logic programs. When this method is applied to normal logic programs with aggregates, the well-justified FLP semantics agrees with the conditional satisfaction based semantics defined by (Son, Pontelli, and Tu 2007); and when applied to dl-programs, the semantics agrees with the strongly well-supported semantics defined by (Shen 2011).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4825/5276,answer set programming;semantics

The task of a diagnosis engine is to compute diagnoses, which are assumptions on the health of components in the diagnosed system that explain the observation. In this paper, we extend Reiter's well-known theory of diagnosis by exploiting the duality of the relation between conflicts and diagnoses. This duality means that a diagnosis is a hitting set of conflicts, but a conflict is also a hitting set of diagnoses. We use this property to interleave the search for diagnoses and conflicts: a set of conflicts can guide the search for diagnosis, and the computed diagnoses can guide the search for more conflicts. We provide the formal basis for this dual conflict-diagnosis relation, and propose a novel diagnosis algorithm that exploits this duality. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is able to find a minimal cardinality diagnosis faster than the well-known Conflict-Directed A*.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5182/5277,"Artificial Intelligence, Model-based diagnosis, reasoning"

While OBDDs are characterized by total variable orders, SDDs are characterized by dissections of variable orders, known as vtrees. Despite this generality, SDDs retain a number of properties, such as canonicity and a polytime apply operator, that have been critical to the practical success of OBDDs. Moreover, upper bounds on the size of SDDs were also given, which are tighter than comparable upper bounds on the size of OBDDs. In this paper, we analyze more closely some of the theoretical properties of SDDs and their size. In particular, we consider the impact of basing decisions on sentences (using dissections as in SDDs), in comparison to basing decisions on variables (using total variable orders as in OBDDs). Here, we identify a class of Boolean functions where basing decisions on sentences using dissections of a variable order can lead to exponentially more compact SDDs, compared to OBDDs based on the same variable order. Moreover, we identify a fundamental property of the decompositions that underlie SDDs and use it to show how certain changes to a vtree can also lead to exponential differences in the size of an SDD.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4977/5279,

The diversity in user population seen in large user bases can overwhelm conventional one-size-fits-all classiﬁcation approaches. Although personalized models are better able to handle population diversity, they often require increased effort from the end user during training and are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an activity classification framework that is scalable and can tractably handle an increasing number of users. Scalability is achieved by maintaining distinct groups of similar users during the training process, which makes it possible to account for the differences between users without resorting to training individualized classifiers. The proposed framework keeps user burden low by leveraging crowd-sourced data labels, where simple natural language processing techniques in combination with multi-instance learning are used to handle labeling errors introduced by low-commitment everyday users.

We derive an adaptive upper bound on the step-size parameter to guarantee that online TD learning with linear function approximation will not diverge. We then empirically evaluate algorithms using this upper bound as a heuristic for adapting the step-size parameter online. We compare performance with related work including HL(λ) and Autostep.

141,2012,Machine Learning,Topic Correlation Analysis for Cross-Domain Text Classification,"Lianghao Li, Xiaoming Jin, Mingsheng Long","Cross-domain text classification aims to automatically train a precise text classifier for a target domain by using labeled text data from a related source domain. To this end, the distribution gap between different domains has to be reduced. In previous works, a certain number of shared latent features (e.g., latent topics, principal components, etc.) are extracted to represent documents from different domains, and thus reduce the distribution gap. However, only relying the shared latent features as the domain bridge may limit the amount of knowledge transferred. This limitation is more serious when the distribution gap is so large that only a small number of latent features can be shared between domains. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Topic Correlation Analysis (TCA), which extracts both the shared and the domain-specific latent features to facilitate effective knowledge transfer. In TCA, all word features are first grouped into the shared and the domain-specific topics using a joint mixture model. Then the correlations between the two kinds of topics are inferred and used to induce a mapping between the domain-specific topics from different domains. Finally, both the shared and the mapped domain-specific topics are utilized to span a new shared feature space where the supervised knowledge can be effectively transferred. The experimental results on two real-world data sets justify the superiority of the proposed method over the stat-of-the-art baselines.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5077/5512,Domain Adaptation; Topic Modeling; Text Classification; Transfer Learning

However, the results learned by PRPCA lack interpretability because each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called sparse probabilistic relational projection (SPRP), to learn a sparse projection matrix for relational dimensionality reduction. The sparsity in SPRP is achieved by imposing on the projection matrix a sparsity-inducing prior such as the Laplace prior or Jeffreys prior. We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the parameters of SPRP. Compared with PRPCA, the sparsity in SPRP not only makes the results more interpretable but also makes the projection operation much more efficient without compromising its accuracy.

This task becomes feasible with MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning), a recently developed learning framework, where each data object is represented by multiple instances and is allowed to be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose KISAR, an MIML algorithm that is able to discover what instances trigger what labels. By considering the fact that highly relevant labels usually share some patterns, we develop a convex optimization formulation and provide an alternating optimization solution.

Ensemble feature selection where multiple feature selection outputs are combined to yield more robust results without sacrificing the performance is an effective method for stable feature selection. In order to make further improvements of the performance (classification accuracy), the diversity regularized ensemble feature weighting framework is presented, in which the base feature selector is based on local learning with logistic loss for its robustness to huge irrelevant features and small samples. At the same time, the sample complexity of the proposed ensemble feature weighting algorithm is analyzed based on the VC-theory.

To exploit the discriminative information in unsupervised scenarios, we perform spectral clustering to learn the cluster labels of the input samples, during which the feature selection is performed simultaneously. The joint learning of the cluster labels and feature selection matrix enables NDFS to select the most discriminative features. To learn more accurate cluster labels, a nonnegative constraint is explicitly imposed to the class indicators. To reduce the redundant or even noisy features, l2,1-norm minimization constraint is added into the objective function, which guarantees the feature selection matrix sparse in rows.

Previous methods usually explore these latent factors by optimizing two separate objective functions, i.e., either maximizing the empirical likelihood, or preserving the geometric structure. Actually, these two objective functions are complementary to each other and optimizing them simultaneously can make the solution smoother and further improve the accuracy of the final model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Graph co-regularized Transfer Learning (GTL) for this purpose, which integrates the two objective functions seamlessly into one unified optimization problem.

Domains in which the sparsity assumption is applicable also offer many interesting large-scale machine learning prediction tasks. It is therefore important to study the effect of random projections as a dimensionality reduction method under such sparsity assumptions. In this paper we develop the bias-variance analysis of a least-squares regression estimator in compressed spaces when random projections are applied on sparse input signals. Leveraging the sparsity assumption, we are able to work with arbitrary non i.i.d. sampling strategies and derive a worst-case bound on the entire space.

Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions concerning the values taken by the input features. It has been shown that rule ensembles for classification can be learnt optimally and efficiently using hierarchical kernel learning approaches that explore the exponentially large space of conjunctions by exploiting its hierarchical structure. The regularizer employed penalizes large features and thereby selects a small set of short features. In this paper, we generalize the rule ensemble learning using hierarchical kernels (RELHKL) framework to multi class structured output spaces. We build on the StructSVM model for sequence prediction problems and employ a ρ-norm hierarchical regularizer for observation features and a conventional 2-norm regularizer for state transition features. The exponentially large feature space is searched using an active set algorithm and the exponentially large set of constraints are handled using a cutting plane algorithm.

While traditional statistical relational representations share factors across sets of interchangeable random variables, representations that explicitly model aggregations also exploit interchangeability of random variables within factors. This is especially useful in decision making settings, where an agent might need to reason about counts of the different types of objects it interacts with. Previous work on counting formulas in statistical relational representations has mostly focused on the problem of exact inference on an existing model. The problem of learning such models is largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Counting Markov Logic Networks (C-MLNs), an extension of Markov logic networks that can compactly represent complex counting formulas. We present a structure learning algorithm for C-MLNs; we apply this algorithm to the novel problem of generalizing natural language instructions, and to relational reinforcement learning in the Crossblock domain, in which standard MLN learning algorithms fail to find any useful structure. The C-MLN policies learned from natural language instructions are compact and intuitive, and, despite requiring no instructions on test games, win 20% more Crossblock games than a state-of-the-art algorithm for following natural language instructions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5134/5523,Relational Learning; Reinforcement Learning; Relational Probabilistic Models; Natural Language Processing

PhiMDP attempts to reduce the general RL problem, where the environment's states and dynamics are both unknown, toan MDP, while MC-AIXI-CTW incrementally learns a mixture of contexttrees as its environment model. The main idea of PhiMDP is toconnect generic reinforcement learning with classical reinforcementlearning. The first implementation of PhiMDP relies on astochastic search procedure for finding a tree that minimizes acertain cost function. This does not guarantee finding theminimizing tree, or even a good one, given limited search time. As aconsequence it appears that the approach has difficulties with largedomains. MC-AIXI-CTW is attractive in that it can incrementally andanalytically compute the internal model through interactions withthe environment. Unfortunately, it is computationally demanding dueto requiring heavy planning simulations at every single time step.We devise a novel approach called CTMRL, which analytically andefficiently finds the cost-minimizing tree. Instead of thecontext-tree weighting method that MC-AIXI-CTW is based on, we usethe closely related context-tree maximizing algorithm that selectsjust one single tree. This approach falls under the PhiMDPframework, which allows the replacement of the costly planningcomponent of MC-AIXI-CTW with simple Q-Learning.

153,2012,Machine Learning,Leveraging Domain Knowledge in Multitask Bayesian Network Structure Learning,"Diane Oyen, Terran Lane","Network structure learning algorithms have aided network discovery in fields such as bioinformatics, neuroscience, ecology and social science. However, challenges remain in learning informative networks for related sets of tasks because the search space of Bayesian network structures is characterized by large basins of approximately equivalent solutions. Multitask algorithms select a set of networks that are near each other in the search space, rather than a score-equivalent set of networks chosen from independent regions of the space. This selection preference allows a domain expert to see only differences supported by the data. However, the usefulness of these algorithms for scientific datasets is limited because existing algorithms naively assume that all pairs of tasks are equally related. We introduce a framework that relaxes this assumption by incorporating domain knowledge about task-relatedness into the learning objective. Using our framework, we introduce the first multitask Bayesian network algorithm that leverages domain knowledge about the relatedness of tasks. We use our algorithm to explore the effect of task-relatedness on network discovery and show that our algorithm learns networks that are closer to ground truth than naive algorithms and that our algorithm discovers patterns that are interesting.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5013/5526,multitask learning; graphical models; transfer learning

Recent studies by Radovanovi´c et al. indicate that in high dimensional spaces, hubs almost always emerge, and objects close to the data centroid tend to become hubs. In this paper, we show that the family of kernels based on the graph Laplacian makes all objects in the dataset equally similar to the centroid, and thus they are expected to make less hubs when used as a similarity measure. We investigate this hypothesis using both synthetic and real-world data. It turns out that these kernels suppress hubs in some cases but not always, and the results seem to be affected by the size of the data—a factor not discussed previously. However, for the datasets in which hubs are indeed reduced by the Laplacian-based kernels, these kernels work well in ranking and classification tasks. This result suggests that the amount of hubs, which can be readily computed in an unsupervised fashion, can be a yardstick of whether Laplacian-based kernels work effectively for a given data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4984/5529,High-dimensional data; Hub; Data centroid; Laplacian-based kernels

While many approximated name matching techniques have been proposed, most are generic string-matching algorithms. Unlike other types of proper names, personal names are highly cultural. Many ethnicities have their own unique naming systems and identifiable characteristics. In this paper we explore such relationships between ethnicities and personal names to improve the name matching performance. First, we propose a name-ethnicity classifier based on the multinomial logistic regression. Our model can effectively identify name-ethnicity from personal names in Wikipedia, which we use to define name-ethnicity, to within 85\% accuracy.Next, we propose a novel alignment-based name matching algorithm, based on Smith–Waterman algorithm and logistic regression.Different name matching models are then trained for different name-ethnicity groups.Our preliminary experimental result on DBLP's disambiguated author dataset yields a performance of 99\% precision and 89\% recall.Surprisingly, textual features carry more weight than phonetic ones in name-ethnicity classification.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5180/5533,ethnicity classification; name matching; logistic regression

However, it can be computationally expensive to learn the local models for datasets that contain a large number of variables and/or examples. This paper pursues a third approach that views Markov network structure learning as a feature generation problem. The algorithm combines a data-driven, specific-to-general search strategy with randomization to quickly generate a large set of candidate features that all have support in the data.

Furthermore, data sets collected from similar generating processes often present different high-dimensional views, even though their underlying manifolds are similar. The ability to align these data sets and extract this common structure is critical for many transfer learning tasks.

Another approach is Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), which aims to learn a single kernel classifier from an optimal  combination of multiple kernels.  However, both approaches suffer from a high computational cost in computing the full kernel matrices and in training, especially when the number of kernels or the number of training examples is very large.  In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing an efficient online kernel selection algorithm. It  incrementally learns  a weight for each kernel classifier. The weight for each kernel classifier can help us to select a good kernel among a set of given kernels.  The proposed approach is efficient in that (i) it is an online approach and therefore avoids computing all the full kernel matrices before training; (ii) it only updates a single kernel classifier each time by a sampling technique and therefore saves time on updating kernel classifiers with poor performance; (iii) it has a theoretically  guaranteed  performance compared to the best kernel predictor.  Empirical studies on image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for selecting a good kernel among a set of kernels.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4997/5541,kernel learning; online learning; kernel selection
169,2012,Machine Learning,Pairwise Exemplar Clustering,"Yingzhen Yang, Xinqi Chu, Feng Liang, Thomas S. Huang","Exemplar-based clustering methods have been extensively shown to be effective in many clustering problems. They adaptively determine the number of clusters and hold the appealing advantage of not requiring the estimation of latent parameters, which is otherwise difficult in case of complicated parametric model and high dimensionality of the data. However, modeling arbitrary underlying distribution of the data is still difficult for existing exemplar-based clustering methods. We present Pairwise Exemplar Clustering (PEC) to alleviate this problem by modeling the underlying cluster distributions more accurately with non-parametric kernel density estimation. Interpreting the clusters as classes from a supervised learning perspective, we search for an optimal partition of the data that balances two quantities: 1 the misclassification rate of the data partition for separating the clusters; 2 the sum of within-cluster dissimilarities for controlling the cluster size. The broadly used kernel form of cut turns out to be a special case of our formulation. Moreover, we optimize the corresponding objective function by a new efficient algorithm for message computation in a pairwise MRF. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4963/5542,Clustering; Kernel density estimation; Misclassification rate; Supervised learning; Message computation

A straightforward approach is to apply stochastic approximation to KLR. We refer to this approach as non-conservative online learning algorithm because it updates the kernel classifier after every received training example, leading to a dense classifier. To improve the sparsity of the KLR classifier, we propose two conservative online learning algorithms that update the classifier in a stochastic manner and generate sparse solutions. With appropriately designed updating strategies, our analysis shows that the two conservative algorithms enjoy similar theoretical guarantee as that of the non-conservative algorithm. Empirical studies on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that compared to batch-mode algorithms for KLR, the proposed conservative online learning algorithms are able to produce sparse KLR classifiers, and achieve similar classification accuracy but with significantly shorter training time. Furthermore, both the sparsity and classification accuracy of our methods are comparable to those of the online kernel SVM.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5003/5544,Sparse kernel logistic regression

Xing","Many noise models do not faithfully reflect the noise processes introduced during data collection in many real-world applications. In particular, we argue that a type of noise referred to as sparse noise is quite commonly found in many applications and many existing works have been proposed to model such sparse noise. However, all the existing works only focus on unsupervised learning without considering the supervised information, i.e., label information. In this paper, we consider how to model and handle sparse noise in the context of embedding high-dimensional data under a probabilistic formulation for supervised learning. We propose a supervised probabilistic robust embedding (SPRE) model in which data are corrupted either by sparse noise or by a combination of Gaussian and sparse noises. By using the Laplace distribution as a prior to model sparse noise, we devise a two-fold variational EM learning algorithm in which the update of model parameters has analytical solution.

Most existing methods for supervised tensor learning use only rank-one weight tensors in the linear model and cannot readily incorporate domain knowledge. In our framework, we obtain the weight tensor in a hierarchical way — we first approximate it by a low-rank tensor, and then estimate the low-rank approximation using the prior knowledge from various sources, e.g., different domain experts. This is motivated by wafer quality prediction in semiconductor manufacturing. Furthermore, we propose an effective algorithm named H-MOTE for solving this framework, which is guaranteed to converge. The time complexity of H-MOTE is linear with respect to the number of examples as well as the size of the weight tensor.

Stackelberg games model the fact that a strategic attacker can surveil and exploit the defender's strategy, and randomization guards against the worst effects by making the defender less predictable. In accordance with the standard game-theoretic model of Stackelberg games, past work has typically assumed that the attacker has perfect knowledge of the defender's randomized strategy and will react correspondingly. In light of the fact that surveillance is costly, risky, and delays an attack, this assumption is clearly simplistic: attackers will usually act on partial knowledge of the defender's strategies. The attacker's imperfect estimate could present opportunities and possibly also threats to a strategic defender.In this paper, we therefore begin a systematic study of security games with limited surveillance. We propose a natural model wherein an attacker forms or updates a belief based on observed actions, and chooses an optimal response. We investigate the model both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we give mathematical programs to compute optimal attacker and defender strategies for a fixed observation duration, and show how to use them to estimate the attacker's observation durations. Our experimental results show that the defender can achieve significant improvement in expected utility by taking the attacker's limited surveillance into account, validating the motivation of our work.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4836/5453,

Recently, Alcalde-Unzu and Molis (2011) and Jaramillo and Manjunath (2011) independently examined housing markets in which agents can express indiﬀerences among houses. They proposed two important families of mechanisms, known as TTAS and TCR respectively. We formulate a family of mechanisms which not only includes TTAS and TCR but also satisﬁes many desirable properties of both families. As a corollary, we show that TCR is strict core selecting (if the strict core is non-empty). Finally, we settle an open question regarding the computational complexity of the TTAS mechanism.

Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and assume prior knowledge of the model. We propose a distributed reinforcement learning approach, where agents take turns to learn best responses to each other’s policies. This promotes decentralization of the policy computation problem, and relaxes reliance on the full knowledge of the problem parameters. We derive the relation between the sample complexity of best response learning and error tolerance. Our key contribution is to show that sample complexity could grow exponentially with the problem horizon. We show empirically that even if the sample requirement is set lower than what theory demands, our learning approach can produce (near) optimal policies in some benchmark Dec-POMDP problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5095/5455,Distributed Reinforcement Learning; Decentralized POMDP

In this paper, we design an iterative algorithm that finds an ε-approximate Markov perfect equilibrium with two-player zero-sum continuous stochastic games with switching controller. When the game is polynomial (i.e., utility and state transitions are polynomial functions), our algorithm converges to ε = 0 by exploiting semidefinite programming. When the game is not polynomial, the algorithm exploits polynomial approximations and converges to an ε value whose upper bound is a function of the maximum approximation error with infinity norm. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for equilibrium approximation with arbitrary utility and transition functions providing theoretical guarantees.

179,2012,Multiagent Systems,A Dynamic Rationalization of Distance Rationalizability,"Craig Boutilier, Ariel D. Procaccia","Distance rationalizability is an intuitive paradigm for developing and studying voting rules: given a notion of consensus and a distance function on preference profiles, a rationalizable voting rule selects an alternative that is closest to being a consensus winner. Despite its appeal, distance rationalizability faces the challenge of connecting the chosen distance measure and consensus notion to an operational measure of social desirability. We tackle this issue via the decision-theoretic framework of dynamic social choice, in which a social choice Markov decision process (MDP) models the dynamics of voter preferences in response to winner selection. We show that, for a prominent class of distance functions, one can construct a social choice MDP, with natural preference dynamics and rewards, such that a voting rule is (votewise) rationalizable with respect to the unanimity consensus for a given distance function iff it is a (deterministic) optimal policy in the MDP. This provides an alternative rationale for distance rationalizability, demonstrating the equivalence of rationalizable voting rules in a static sense and winner selection to maximize societal utility in a dynamic process.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4930/5458,

A notable exception, possibly caused by some confusion regarding its exact definition, is the method of ranked pairs. The original version of the method, due to Tideman, yields a social preference function that is irresolute and neutral. A variant introduced subsequently uses an exogenously given tie-breaking rule and therefore fails neutrality. The latter variant is the one most commonly studied in the area of computational social choice, and it is easy to see that its winner determination problem is computationally tractable. We show that by contrast, computing the set of winners selected by Tideman's original ranked pairs method is NP-complete, thus revealing a trade-off between tractability and neutrality. In addition, several known results concerning the hardness of manipulation and the complexity of computing possible and necessary winners are shown to follow as corollaries from our findings.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5018/5461,ranked pairs

To do this we adopt the standard mechanism design paradigm where utility is assumed to be quasilinear and thus transferable across agents. We generalize the traditional binary criteria of envy-freeness, proportionality, and efficiency (welfare) to measures of degree that range between 0 and 1. We demonstrate that in the canonical fair division settings under any allocatively-efficient mechanism the worst-case welfare rate is 0 and disproportionality rate is 1; in other words, the worst-case results are as bad as possible. This strongly motivates an average-case analysis. We then set as the goal identification of a mechanism that achieves high welfare, low envy, and low disproportionality in expectation across a spectrum of fair division settings. We establish that the VCG mechanism is not a satisfactory candidate, but the redistribution mechanism of [Bailey, 1997; Cavallo, 2006] is.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5115/5462,fair division; mechanism design; redistribution

We extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation games with N agents and C resources. We show that for any convention, there exists a symmetric subgame perfect equilibrium which implements it. We present two conventions: bourgeois, where agents stick to the first allocation; and market, where agents pay for the use of resources, and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocations. We define price of anonymity of a convention as the ratio between the maximum social payoff of any (asymmetric) strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the convention.

Procaccia, Tuomas Sandholm","In many dynamic matching applications — especially high-stakes ones — the competitive ratios of prior-free online algorithms are unacceptably poor.  The algorithm should take distributional information about possible futures into account in deciding what action to take now.  This is typically done by drawing sample trajectories of possible futures at each time period, but may require a prohibitively large number of trajectories or prohibitive memory and/or computation to decide what action to take.  Instead, we propose to learn potentials of elements (e.g., vertices) of the current problem.  Then, at run time, we simply run an offline matching algorithm at each time period, but subtracting out in the objective the potentials of the elements used up in the matching. We apply the approach to kidney exchange.  Kidney exchanges enable willing but incompatible patient-donor pairs (vertices) to swap donors. These swaps typically include cycles longer than two pairs and chains triggered by altruistic donors.  Fielded exchanges currently match myopically, maximizing the number of patients who get kidneys in an offline fashion at each time period. Myopic matching is sub-optimal; the clearing problem is dynamic since patients, donors, and altruists appear and expire over time.  We theoretically compare the power of using potentials on increasingly large elements: vertices, edges, cycles, and the entire graph (optimum).  Then, experiments show that by learning vertex potentials, our algorithm matches more patients than the current practice of clearing myopically.

While the base algorithm performs a full tree traversal on each iteration, Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) reduces the per iteration time cost by traversing just a sampled portion of the tree.  On the other hand, MCCFR's sampled values introduce variance, and the effects of this variance were previously unknown.  In this paper, we generalize MCCFR by considering any generic estimator of the sought values.  We show that any choice of an estimator can be used to probabilistically minimize regret, provided the estimator is bounded and unbiased.  In addition, we relate the variance of the estimator to the convergence rate of an algorithm that calculates regret directly from the estimator.  We demonstrate the application of our analysis by defining a new bounded, unbiased estimator with empirically lower variance than MCCFR estimates.  Finally, we use this estimator in a new sampling algorithm to compute approximate equilibria in Goofspiel, Bluff, and Texas hold'em poker.

This paper identifies the concept of the deployment-to-saturation ratio in random Stackelberg security games, and shows that problem instances for which this ratio is 0.5 are computationally harder than instances with other deployment-to-saturation ratios for a wide range of different equilibrium computation methods, including (i) previously published different MIP algorithms, and (ii) different underlying solvers and solution mechanisms. This finding has at least two important implications. First, it is important for new algorithms to be evaluated on the hardest problem instances. We show that this has often not been done in the past, and introduce a publicly available benchmark suite to facilitate such comparisons. Second, we provide evidence that this computationally hard region is also one where optimization would be of most benefit to security agencies, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area. Furthermore, we use the concept of phase transitions to better understand this computationally hard region. We define a decision problem related to security games, and show that the probability that this problem has a solution exhibits a phase transition as the deployment-to-saturation ratio crosses 0.5.

A standard approach in such cases is to apply a lossy state-space abstraction technique to produce a smaller abstract game that can be tractably solved, while hoping that the resulting abstract game equilibrium is close to an equilibrium strategy in the unabstracted game. Recent work has shown that this assumption is unreliable, and an arbitrary Nash equilibrium in the abstract game is unlikely to be even near the least suboptimal strategy that can be represented in that space.

As the game-state is updated regularly at short intervals (i.e. point-level), a library of successful and unsuccessful plans of a player can be learnt over time. Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of a player’s plans, a set of proven plans or tactics from the library that characterize a player can be identified. For low-scoring, continuous team sports like soccer, such analysis for multi-agent teams does not exist as the game is not segmented into “discretized” plays (i.e. plans), making it difficult to obtain a library that characterizes a team’s behavior. Additionally, as player tracking data is costly and difficult to obtain, we only have partial team tracings in the form of ball actions which makes this problem even more difficult. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome these issues by representing team behavior via play-segments, which are spatio-temporal descriptions of ball movement over fixed windows of time. Using these representations we can characterize team behavior from entropy maps, which give a measure of predictability of team behaviors across the field.

Thus, we are able to establish the baseline performance in this domain, even without complete information on footballers' performances (accessible to human managers), showing that our agent is able to rank at around the top percentile when pitched against 2.5M human players.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5088/5473,
196,2012,Multiagent Systems,Congestion Games with Agent Failures,"Reshef Meir, Moshe Tennenholtz, Yoram Bachrach, Peter Key","We propose a natural model for agent failures in congestion games. In our model, each of the agents may fail to participate in the game, introducing uncertainty regarding the set of active agents. We examine how such uncertainty may change the Nash equilibria (NE) of the game. We prove that although the perturbed game induced by the failure model is not always a congestion game, it still admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium. Then, we turn to examine the effect of failures on the maximal social cost in any NE of the perturbed game. We show that in the limit case where failure probability is negligible new equilibria never emerge, and that the social cost may decrease but it never increases. For the case of non-negligible failure probabilities, we provide a full characterization of the maximal impact of failures on the social cost under worst-case equilibrium outcomes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4987/5474,Game theory; Congestion games; failures
197,2012,Multiagent Systems,Bayes-Adaptive Interactive POMDPs,"Brenda Ng, Kofi Boakye, Carol Meyers, Andrew Wang","We introduce the Bayes-Adaptive Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (BA-IPOMDP), the first multiagent decision model that explicitly incorporates model learning. As in I-POMDPs, the BA-IPOMDP agent maintains beliefs over interactive states, which include the physical states as well as the other agents’ models. The BA-IPOMDP assumes that the state transition and observation probabilities are unknown, and augments the interactive states to include these parameters. Beliefs are maintained over this augmented interactive state space. This (necessary) state expansion exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, especially since each I-POMDP belief update is already a recursive procedure (because an agent invokes belief updates from other agents’ perspectives as part of its own belief update, in order to anticipate other agents’ actions). We extend the interactive particle filter to perform approximate belief update on BA-IPOMDPs. We present our findings on the multiagent Tiger problem.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5120/5475,Multiagent Learning; Multiagent Planning; Reasoning under Uncertainty; Sequential Decision Making
198,2012,Multiagent Systems,Tree-Based Solution Methods for Multiagent POMDPs with Delayed Communication,"Frans Adriaan Oliehoek, Matthijs T. J. Spaan","Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (MPOMDPs) provide a powerful framework for optimal decision making under the assumption of instantaneous communication. We focus on a delayed communication setting (MPOMDP-DC), in which broadcasted information is delayed by at most one time step. This model allows agents to act on their most recent (private) observation. Such an assumption is a strict generalization over having agents wait until the global information is available and is more appropriate for applications in which response time is critical. In this setting, however, value function backups are significantly more costly, and naive application of incremental pruning, the core of many state-of-the-art optimal POMDP techniques, is intractable. In this paper, we overcome this problem by demonstrating that computation of the MPOMDP-DC backup can be structured as a tree and introducing two novel tree-based pruning techniques that exploit this structure in an effective way. We experimentally show that these methods have the potential to outperform naive incremental pruning by orders of magnitude, allowing for the solution of larger problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5066/5476,"multiagent planning, delayed communication, tree-based pruning"

We formalize the interface between such local models as the influence agents can exert on one another; and we prove that this interface is sufficient for decoupling them. The resulting influence-based abstraction substantially generalizes previous work on exploiting weakly-coupled agent interaction structures. Therein lie several important contributions. First, our general formulation sheds new light on the theoretical relationships among previous approaches, and promotes future empirical comparisons that could come by extending them beyond the more specific problem contexts for which they were developed. More importantly, the influence-based approaches that we generalize have shown promising improvements in the scalability of planning for more restrictive models. Thus, our theoretical result here serves as the foundation for practical algorithms that we anticipate will bring similar improvements to more general planning contexts, and also into other domains such as approximate planning, decision-making in adversarial domains, and online learning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5047/5478,decision-theoretic planning; influence-based abstraction;

Schulze's rule is used in the elections of many organizations, including the Wikimedia Foundation, the Pirate Party of Sweden and Germany, the Debian project, and the Gento Project.  Both rules are immune to control by cloning alternatives, but little is otherwise known about their strategic robustness, including resistance to manipulation by one or more voters, control by adding or deleting alternatives, adding or deleting votes, and bribery.  Considering computational barriers, we show that these types of strategic behavior are NP-hard for ranked pairs (both constructive, in making an alternative a winner, and destructive, in precluding an alternative from being a winner). Schulze's rule, in comparison, remains vulnerable at least to constructive manipulation by a single voter and destructive manipulation by a coalition. As the first such polynomial-time rule known to resist all such manipulations, and considering also the broad axiomatic support, ranked pairs seems worthwhile to consider for practical applications.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5075/5479,

Decentralized SCF appears as a highly intricate task because agents only possess local information and have limited knowledge about the capabilities of other agents. The decentralized SCF problem has been recently cast as an optimization problem that can be efficiently approximated using max-sum loopy belief propagation. Along this direction, in this paper we propose a novel encoding of the problem into a binary factor graph (containing only binary variables) as well as an alternative algorithm.

A key aspect of the protocolis that the exploration’s execution may interleaves ith the negotiation itself, inflicting some degradationon the exploration’s flexibility. The advantage of this form of negotiation is in enabling the agents supervising that the exploration’s execution takes place in its agreedform as negotiated. We show that in many cases, much of the computational complexity of the new protocol can be eliminated by solving an alternative negotiation scheme according to which the parties first negotiate theexploration terms as a whole and then execute it. As demonstrated in the paper, the solution characteristics of the new protocol are somehow different from thoseof legacy negotiation protocols where the execution of the agreement reached through the negotiation is completely separated from the negotiation process. Furthermore, if the agents are given the option to control some of the negotiation protocol parameters, the resulting exploration may be suboptimal. In particular we show that the increase in an agent’s expected utility in such casesis unbounded and so is the resulting decrease in the social welfare. Surprisingly, we show that further increasingone of the agents’ level of control in some of thenegotiation parameters enables bounding the resultingdecrease in the social welfare.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4992/5482,Multiagent Systems; Negotiation and Contract-Based Systems; Coordination and Collaboration
204,2012,Multiagent Systems,Optimal Auctions for Spiteful Bidders,"Pingzhong Tang, Tuomas Sandholm","Designing revenue-optimal auctions for various settings is perhaps the most important, yet sometimes most elusive, problem in mechanism design. Spiteful bidders have been intensely studied recently, especially because spite occurs in many applications in multiagent system and electronic commerce. We derive the optimal auction for such bidders (as well as bidders that are altruistic). It is a generalization of Myerson’s (1981) auction. It chooses an allocation that maximizes agents’ virtual valuations, but for a generalized definition of virtual valuation. The payment rule is less intuitive. For one, it takes each bidder’s own report into consideration when determining his payment. Moreover, bidders pay even if the seller keeps the item; a similar phenomenon has been shown in other settings with neg- ative externalities (Jehiel, Moldovanu, and Stacchetti 1996; Deng and Pekec 2011). On the other hand, a novel aspect of our auction is that it sometimes subsidizes losers when the item is sold to some other bidder. We also derive a revenue equivalence theorem for this setting. Using it, we generate a short proof of (a slight generalization of) the previously known result that, in two-bidder settings with independently uniformly drawn valuations, second-price auctions yield greater expected revenue than first-price auctions. Finally, we present a template for comparing the expected revenues of any two auction mechanisms that have the same allocation rule (for the valuations distributions at hand).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4812/5483,Revenue maximization; Optimal auction; Externality; Spiteful; Altrusm

Nguyen, Milind Tambe","Many strategic actions carry a ‘contagious’ component beyond the immediate locale of the effort itself. Viral marketing and peacekeeping operations have both been observed to have a spreading effect. In this work, we use counterinsurgency as our illustrative domain. Defined as the effort to block the spread of support for an insurgency, such operations lack the manpower to defend the entire population and must focus onthe opinions of a subset of local leaders. As past researchers of security resource allocation have done, we propose using game theory to develop such policies and model the interconnected network of leaders as a graph. Unlike this past work in security games, actions in these domains possess a probabilistic, non-local impact. To address this new class of security games, we combine recent research in influence blocking maximization with a double oracle approach and create novel heuristic oracles to generate mixed strategies for a real-world leadership network from Afghanistan, synthetic leadership networks, and a real social network. We find that leadership networks that exhibit highly interconnected clusters can be solved equally well by our heuristic methods, but our more sophisticated heuristics outperform simpler ones in less interconnected social networks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5014/5484,Security games; contagion; social networks
206,2012,Multiagent Systems,Decision Support for Agent Populations in Uncertain and Congested Environments,"Pradeep Varakantham, Shih-Fen Cheng, Geoff Gordon, Asrar Ahmed","This research is motivated by large scale problems in urban transportation and labor mobility where there is congestion for resources and uncertainty in movement. In such domains, even though the individual agents do not have an identity of their own and do not explicitly interact with other agents, they effect other agents. While there has been much research in handling such implicit effects, it has primarily assumed de- terministic movements of agents. We address the issue of decision support for individual agents that are identical and have involuntary movements in dynamic environments. For instance, in a taxi fleet serving a city, when a taxi is hired by a customer, its movements are uncontrolled and depend on (a) the customers requirement; and (b) the location of other taxis in the fleet. Towards addressing decision support in such problems, we make two key contributions: (a) A framework to represent the decision problem for selfish individuals in a dynamic population, where there is transitional uncertainty (involuntary movements); and (b) Two techniques (Fictitious Play for Symmetric Agent Populations, FP-SAP and Soft- max based Flow Update, SMFU) that converge to equilibrium solutions. We show that our techniques (apart from providing equilibrium strategies) outperform “driver” strategies with re- spect to overall availability of taxis and the revenue obtained by the taxi drivers. We demonstrate this on a real world data set with 8,000 taxis and 83 zones (representing the entire area of Singapore).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5030/5485,Planning under uncertainty; Congestion games; Markov Decision Problems

Much of the work to date focuses on devising a fixed randomized strategy for the defender, accounting for an attacker who optimally responds to it. In practice, defense policies are often subject to constraints and vary over time, allowing an attacker to infer characteristics of future policies based on current observations. A defender must therefore account for an attacker's observation capabilities in devising a security policy. We show that this general modeling framework can be captured using stochastic Stackelberg games (SSGs), where a defender commits to a dynamic policy to which the attacker devises an optimal dynamic response. We then offer the following contributions. 1) We show that Markov stationary policies suffice in SSGs, 2) present a finite-time mixed-integer non-linear program for computing a Stackelberg equilibrium in SSGs, and 3) present a mixed-integer linear program to approximate it. 4) We illustrate our algorithms on a simple SSG representing an adversarial patrolling scenario, where we study the impact of attacker patience and risk aversion on optimal defense policies.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4811/5486,Game theory; Stackelberg equilibrium; stochastic games; game theory and security
208,2012,Multiagent Systems,Evaluating Resistance to False-Name Manipulations in Elections,"Bo Waggoner, Lirong Xia, Vincent Conitzer","In many mechanisms (especially online mechanisms), a strategic agent can inﬂuence the outcome by creating multiple false identities. We consider voting settings where the mechanism designer cannot completely prevent false-name manipulation, but may use false-name-limiting methods such as CAPTCHAs to inﬂuence the amount and characteristics of such manipulation. Such a designer would prefer, ﬁrst, a high probability of obtaining the “correct” outcome, and second, a statistical method for evaluating the correctness of the outcome. In this paper, we focus on settings with two alternatives. We model voters as independently drawing a number of identities from a distribution that may be inﬂuenced by the choice of the false-name-limiting method. We give a criterion for the evaluation and comparison of these distributions.

The original peer prediction method is incentive compatible for any number of agents n >= 2, but relies on a common prior, shared by all agents and the mechanism. The Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) relaxes this assumption. While BTS still assumes that agents share a common prior, this prior need not be known to the mechanism. However, BTS is only incentive compatible for a large enough number of agents, and the particular number of agents required is uncertain because it depends on this private prior. In this paper, we present a robust BTS for the elicitation of binary information which is incentive compatible for every n >= 3, taking advantage of a particularity of the quadratic scoring rule. The robust BTS is the first peer prediction mechanism to provide strict incentive compatibility for every n >= 3 without relying on knowledge of the common prior.

Two notions that prove to be very useful in this context are Linear Programming (LP) duality and convexity. In this work, we apply these tools to identify games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) that admit stable outcomes. We focus on three notions of the core defined in (Chalkiadakis et al. 2010) for such games, namely, the conservative core, the refined core and the optimistic core. First, we show that the conservative core of an OCF game is non-empty if and only if the core of a related classic coalitional game is non-empty. This enables us to improve the result of (Chalkiadakis et al. 2010) by giving a strictly weaker sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the conservative core. We then use LP duality to characterize OCF games with non-empty refined core; as a corollary, we show that the refined core of a game is non-empty as long as the superadditive cover of its characteristic function is convex. Finally, we identify a large class of OCF games that can be shown to have a non-empty optimistic core using an LP based argument.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5057/5490,Cooperative Games; Overlapping Coalitions; Convexity; Linear Programming

This problem arises in many real world applications such as route selection systems and office assistants. To succeed in such settings agents must reason about how their actions in the present influence people's future actions. This work models such settings as a family of repeated bilateral games of incomplete information called ``choice selection processes'', in which players may share certain goals, but are essentially self-interested. The paper describes several possible models of human behavior that were inspired by behavioral economic theories of people's play in repeated interactions. These models were incorporated into several agent designs to repeatedly generate offers to people playing the game. These agents were evaluated in extensive empirical investigations including hundreds of subjects that interacted with computers in different choice selections processes. The results revealed that an agent that combined a hyperbolic discounting model of human behavior with a social utility function was able to outperform alternative agent designs, including an agent that approximated the optimal strategy using continuous MDPs and an agent using epsilon-greedy strategies to describe people's behavior. We show that this approach was able to generalize to new people as well as choice selection processes that were not used for training.

Is the mind modular in terms of its being profitably described as a collection of relatively independent functional units? Does the regular structure of the cortex imply a single algorithm at work, operating on many different inputs in parallel? Can the cognitive differences between humans and our closest primate relatives be explained in terms of a scalable cortical architecture? We bring to bear diverse sources of evidence to argue that the answers to each of these questions — with some judicious qualifications — are in the affirmative. In particular, we argue that while our higher cognitive functions may interact in a complicated fashion, many of the component functions operate through well-defined interfaces and, perhaps more important, are built on a neural substrate that scales easily under the control of a modular genetic architecture. Processing in the primary sensory cortices seem amenable to similar algorithmic principles, and, even for those cases where alternative principles are at play, the regular structure of cortex allows the same or greater advantages as the architecture scales. Similar genetic machinery to that used by nature to scale body plans has apparently been applied to scale cortical computations. The resulting replicated computing units can be used to build larger working memory and support deeper recursions needed to qualitatively improve our abilities to handle language, abstraction and social interaction.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5093/5299,neural models; modular minds; primate neocortex

Most existing computational visual saliency models follow a bottom-up framework that generates independent saliency map in each selected visual feature space and combines them in a proper way. Two big challenges to be addressed explicitly in these methods are (1) which features should be extracted for all pixels of the input image and (2) how to dynamically determine importance of the saliency map generated in each feature space. In order to address these problems, we present a novel saliency map computational model based on tensor decomposition and reconstruction. Tensor representation and analysis not only explicitly represent image's color values but also imply two important relationships inherent to color image. One is reflecting spatial correlations between pixels and the other one is representing  interplay between color channels. Therefore, saliency map generator based on the proposed model can adaptively find the most suitable features and their combinational coefficients for each pixel. Experiments on a synthetic image set and a real image set show that our method is superior or comparable to other prevailing saliency map models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4864/5305,"visual attention, visual saliency, tensor analysis"
223,2012,Multidisciplinary Topics,Identifying Bullies with a Computer Game,"Juan Fernando Mancilla-Caceres, Wen Pu, Eyal Amir, Dorothy Espelage","Current computer involvement in adolescent social networks (youth between the ages of 11 and 17) provides new opportunities to study group dynamics, interactions amongst peers, and individual preferences. Nevertheless, most of the research in this area focuses on efficiently retrieving information that is explicit in large social networks (e.g., properties of the graph structure), but not on how to use the dynamics of the virtual social network to discover latent characteristics of the real-world social network. In this paper, we present the analysis of a game designed to take advantage of the familiarity of adolescents with online social networks, and describe how the data generated by the game can be used to identify bullies in 5th grade classrooms. We present a probabilistic model of the game and using the in-game interactions of the players (i.e., content of chat messages) infer their social role within their classroom (either a bully or non-bully). The evaluation of our model is done by using previously collected data from psychological surveys on the same 5th grade population and by comparing the performance of the new model with off-the-shelf classifiers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5140/5901,AI and Social Sciences; Social Networks

While a clinical trial of a drug may use only a thousand patients, once a drug is released on the market it may be taken by millions of patients. As a result, in many cases adverse drug events (ADEs) are observed in the broader population that were not identiﬁed during clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need for continued, postmarketing surveillance of drugs to identify previously-unanticipated ADEs. This paper casts this problem as a reverse machine learning task, related to relational subgroup discovery and provides an initial evaluation of this approach based on experiments with an actual EMR/EHR and known adverse drug events.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4941/5307,relational learning; inductive logic programming; adverse drug events; pharmacovigilance

In this paper we propose an unsupervised method for boundary detection, combining three basic principles: novelty, homogeneity, and repetition. In particular, the method uses what we call structure features, a representation encapsulating both local and global properties of a time series. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in detecting music structure boundaries, a task that has received much attention in recent years and for which exist several benchmark datasets and publicly available annotations. We find our method to significantly outperform the best accuracies published so far.

In particular, given a proof problem p (of the form “Left-hand-side-term = Right-hand-side-term”), we show how to automatically generate problems that are similar to p. We believe that such a tool can be used by teachers in making examinations where they need to test students on problems similar to what they taught in class, and by students in generating practice problems tailored to their specific needs. Our first insight is that we can generalize p syntactically to a query Q that implicitly represents a set of problems [[Q]] (which includes p). Our second insight is that we can explore the space of problems [[Q]] automatically, use classical results from polynomial identity testing to generate only those problems in [[Q]] that are correct, and then use pruning techniques to generate only unique and interesting problems. Our third insight is that with a small amount of manual tuning on the query Q, the user can interactively guide the computer to generate problems of interest to her. We present the technical details of the above mentioned steps, and also describe a tool where these steps have been implemented. We also present an empirical evaluation on a wide variety of problems from various sub-fields of algebra including polynomials, trigonometry, calculus, determinants etc. Our tool is able to generate a rich corpus of similar problems from each given problem; while some of these similar problems were already present in the textbook, several were new!",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5133/5310,Algebra; Problem Generation; Synthesis; HCI; Computer-Aided Education
228,2012,Multidisciplinary Topics,Cruising with a Battery-Powered Vehicle and Not Getting Stranded,"Sabine Storandt, Stefan Funke","The main hindrance to a widespread market penetration of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) has been their limited energy reservoir resulting in cruising ranges of few hundred kilometers unless one allows for recharging or switching of depleted batteries during a trip. Unfortunately, recharging typically takes several hours and battery switch stations providing fully recharged batteries are still quite rare – certainly not as widespread as ordinary gas stations. For not getting stranded with an empty battery, going on a BEV trip requires some planning ahead taking into account energy characteristics of the BEV as well as available battery switch stations. In this paper we consider very basic, yet fundamental problems for E-Mobility: Can I get from A to B and back with my BEV without recharging in between? Can I get from A to B when allowed to recharge? How can I minimize the number of battery switches when going from A to B?

Different cardiac assessment tools have been developed to address this goal. Recent research has focused on heart rate motifs, i.e., short-term heart rate sequences that are over- or under-represented in long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients experiencing cardiovascular outcomes, which provide novel and valuable information for risk stratification. However, this approach can leverage only a small number of motifs for prediction and results in difficult to interpret models. We address these limitations by identifying latent structure in the large numbers of motifs found in long-term ECG recordings. In particular, we explore the application of topic models to heart rate time series to identify functional sets of heart rate sequences and to concisely describe patients using task-independent features for various cardiovascular outcomes. We evaluate the approach on a large collection of real-world ECG data, and investigate the performance of topic mixture features for the prediction of cardiovascular mortality. The topics provided an interpretable representation of the recordings and maintained valuable information for clinical assessment when compared with motif frequencies, even after accounting for commonly used clinical risk scores.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5060/5312,

A statistical machine translation (SMT) system is applied to generate new sentences, given the sentences generated previously. For each line of sentence a specific model specially trained for that line is used, as opposed to using a single model for all sentences. To enhance the coherence of sentences on every line, a coherence model using mutual information is applied to select candidates with better consistency with previous sentences.

We argue that more accurate event extraction requires a view of the larger context to decide whether an entity is related to a relevant event. We propose a bottom-up approach to event extraction that initially identifies candidate role fillers independently and then uses that information as well as discourse properties to model textual cohesion. The novel component of the architecture is a sequentially structured sentence classifier that identifies event-related story contexts. The sentence classifier uses lexical associations and discourse relations across sentences, as well as domain-specific distributions of candidate role fillers within and across sentences.

This is done by formulating opinion target extraction (OTE) as a shallow semantic parsing problem with the opinion expression as the predicate and the corresponding targets as its arguments. In principle, our parsing approach to OTE differs from the state-of-the-art sequence labeling one in two aspects. First, we model OTE from parse tree level, where abundant structured syntactic information is available for use, instead of word sequence level, where only lexical information is available. Second, we focus on determining whether a constituent, rather than a word, is an opinion target or not, via a simplified shallow semantic parsing framework. Evaluation on two datasets shows that structured syntactic information plays a critical role in capturing the domination relationship between an opinion expression and its targets.

The goal of this task is to discover the attitude or opinion of the tweets, which is typically formulated as a machine learning based text classification problem. Some methods use manually labeled data to train fully supervised models, while others use some noisy labels, such as emoticons and hashtags, for model training. In general, we can only get a limited number of training data for the fully supervised models because it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to manually label the tweets. As for the models with noisy labels, it is hard for them to achieve satisfactory performance due to the noise in the labels although it is easy to get a large amount of data for training. Hence, the best strategy is to utilize both manually labeled data and noisy labeled data for training. However, how to seamlessly integrate these two different kinds of data into the same learning framework is still a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel model, called emoticon smoothed language model (ESLAM), to handle this challenge. The basic idea is to train a language model based on the manually labeled data, and then use the noisy emoticon data for smoothing. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate that ESLAM can effectively integrate both kinds of data to outperform those methods using only one of them.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5083/5319,

Building a sound labeler requires very large number of correctly labeled training examples, which may not always be possible. On the other hand, crowdsourcing provides an inexpensive yet efficient alternative to collect manual sequential labeling from non-experts. However the quality of crowd labeling cannot be guaranteed, and three kinds of errors are typical: (1) incorrect annotations due to lack of expertise (e.g., labeling gene names from plain text requires corresponding domain knowledge); (2) ignored or omitted annotations due to carelessness or low confidence; (3) noisy annotations due to cheating or vandalism. To correct these mistakes, we present Sembler, a statistical model for ensembling crowd sequential labelings. Sembler considers three types of statistical information: (1) the majority agreement that proves the correctness of an annotation; (2) correct annotation that improves the credibility of the corresponding annotator; (3) correct annotation that enhances the correctness of other annotations which share similar linguistic or contextual features. We evaluate the proposed model on a real Twitter and a synthetical biological data set, and find that Sembler is particularly accurate when more than half of annotators make mistakes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4970/5324,"Crowdsourcing, Sequential Labeling, Conditional Random Fields"

The degree to which two texts are similar has been used extensively as a key feature in much previous work in predicting entailment. However, using similarity scores directly, without proper transformations, results in suboptimal performance. Given a set of lexical similarity measures, we propose a method that jointly learns both (a) a set of non-linear transformation functions for those similarity measures and, (b) the optimal non-linear combination of those transformation functions to predict textual entailment. Our method consistently outperforms numerous baselines, reporting a micro-averaged F-score of 46.48 on the RTE- 7 benchmark dataset.

In this work, we develop one such variant of AO* and apply it to finite-horizon MDPs. This Anytime AO* algorithm eventually delivers an optimal policy while using non-admissible random heuristics that can be sampled, as when the heuristic is the cost of a base policy that can be sampled with rollouts.

The modified problem then becomes easier to analyze, from which we determine an approximate solution for the actual instance on n teams. We present combinatorial techniques to solve the Linear Distance TTP (LD-TTP) for n = 4 and n = 6, without any use of computing, generating the complete set of optimal distances regardless of where the n teams are located. We show that there are only 295 non-isomorphic schedules that can be a solution to the 6-team LD-TTP, and demonstrate that in all previously-solved benchmark TTP instances on 6 teams, the distance-optimal schedule appears in this list of 295, even when the six teams are arranged in a circle or located in three-dimensional space. We then extend the LD-TTP to multiple rounds, and apply our theory to produce a nearly-optimal regular-season schedule for the Nippon Pro Baseball league in Japan.

Weld","UCT, the premier method for solving games such as Go, is also becoming the dominant algorithm for probabilistic planning. Out of the five solvers at the International Probabilistic Planning Competition (IPPC) 2011, four were based on the UCT algorithm. However, while a UCT-based planner, PROST, won the contest, an LRTDP-based system, Glutton, came in a close second, outperforming other systems derived from UCT. These results raise a question: what are the strengths and weaknesses of LRTDP and UCT in practice? This paper starts answering this question by contrasting the two approaches in the context of finite-horizon MDPs. We demonstrate that in such scenarios, UCT's lack of a sound termination condition is a serious practical disadvantage. In order to handle an MDP with a large finite horizon under a time constraint, UCT forces an expert to guess a non-myopic lookahead value for which it should be able to converge on the encountered states. Mistakes in setting this parameter can greatly hurt UCT's performance. In contrast, LRTDP's convergence criterion allows for an iterative deepening strategy. Using this strategy, LRTDP automatically finds the largest lookahead value feasible under the given time constraint. As a result, LRTDP has better performance and stronger theoretical properties.

The primary difficulty to temporal plan evaluation is accounting for temporal constraints that may not be satisfied under all interpretations of the incomplete domain. In this work, we formulate incomplete temporal plan evaluation as a generalization of the temporal consistency problem, called partial temporal consistency. We present a knowledge compilation approach that is combined with symbolic constraint propagation and model counting algorithms for counting the number of incomplete domain model interpretations under which a plan is consistent. We present an evaluation that identifies the aspects of incomplete temporal plans most impact performance.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4875/5335,Planning; Scheduling; Uncertainty

Prior work on SDP has considered only the case of factored states and ignored structure in the action space, causing them to scale poorly in terms of the number of action variables. Our main contribution is to present the first SDP-based planning algorithm for leveraging both state and action space structure in order to compute compactly represented value functions and policies. Since our new algorithm can potentially require more space than when action structure is ignored, our second contribution is to describe an approach for smoothly trading-off space versus time via recursive conditioning. Finally, our third contribution is to introduce a novel SDP approximation that often significantly reduces planning time with little loss in quality by exploiting action structure in weakly coupled MDPs. We present empirical results in three domains with factored action spaces that show that our algorithms scale much better with the number of action variables as compared to state-of-the-art SDP algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5012/5336,"Markov Decision Processes, Decision Theoretic Planning"

Generalizing from previous work in oversubscribed task scheduling, we define a controlled iterative repair search procedure for finding an alternative set of vehicle itineraries in which the overall solution has been feasibly extended to include newly received requests. We first evaluate the performance of this technique on a set of DARP feasibility benchmark problems from the literature. We then consider its use on a real-world DARP problem, where it is necessary to accommodate all requests and constraints must be relaxed when a request cannot be feasibly integrated.

Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing. A key question is how to generate the attacks. This is naturally formulated as planning under uncertainty, i.e., under incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses classical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty by extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to intelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would expect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies on POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed into an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network structure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where needed. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we demonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4996/5338,automated planning ; POMDP; decomposition; penetration testing ; attack planning

This condition is very strong and prevents from solving many interesting problems, for instance where all possible policies reach some dead-end states with a positive probability. We introduce a more general and richer dual optimization criterion, which minimizes the average (undiscounted) cost of only paths leading to the goal among all policies that maximize the probability to reach the goal. We present policy update equations in the form of dynamic programming for this new dual criterion, which are different from the standard Bellman equations, but produce the same solution if there exists one policy leading to the goal with probability 1 from the initial state. We demonstrate that our equations converge in infinite horizon without any condition on the structure of the problem or on its policies, which actually extends the class of SSPs that can be solved. We experimentally show that our dual criterion provides well-founded solutions to SSPs that can not be solved by the standard criterion, and that using a discount factor with the latter certainly provides solution policies but which are not optimal considering our well-founded criterion.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5102/5339,Markov Decision Processes; Stochastic Shortest Path; Planning under Uncertainty; Sequential Decision Making

We present an efficient approach to compute locally-valid approximations to the value function over continuous spaces in time polynomial (O[n^4]) in the dimension n of the state space. To directly tackle the intractability of solving general POMDPs, we leverage the assumption that beliefs are Gaussian distributions over the state space, approximate the belief update using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and represent the value function by a function that is quadratic in the mean and linear in the variance of the belief. Our approach iterates towards a linear control policy over the state space that is locally-optimal with respect to a user defined cost function, and is approximately valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. We demonstrate the scalability and potential of our approach on problems inspired by robot navigation under uncertainty for state spaces of up to 128 dimensions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5159/5340,POMDP; Planning under Uncertainty

We show a close connection between the computations performed by a recent approach for solving MAXSAT and a hitting set approach recently proposed for computing h+. Using this connection we observe that our MAXSAT computation can be initialized with a set of landmarks computed by LM-cut. By judicious use of MAXSAT solving along with a technique of lazy heuristic evaluation we obtain speedups for finding optimal plans over LM-cut on a number of domains.

However, it is of interest to ask whether the symmetry of the model itself before evidence is obtained can be exploited. We present new results showing that this is, in fact, possible.

Second, it uses an uninformative proposal distribution which adversely affects its accuracy. We propose two improvements to LIS that address these limitations. First, we identify a new symmetry in SRL models and define a lifting rule for taking advantage of this symmetry. The lifting rule reduces the variance of LIS.

We propose a provably efficient method to optimize such libraries, leveraging recent advances in optimizing submodular functions of sequences. This approach is demonstrated on two important problems: mobile robot navigation and manipulator grasp set selection. In the first case, performance can be improved by choosing a subset of candidates which optimizes the metric under consideration (cost of traversal).

We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm results in lower overall team costs than other sequential auction algorithms that only assign tasks once.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4751/5363,
280,2012,Robotics,Visual Saliency Estimation through Manifold Learning,"Richard M. Jiang, Danny Crookes","Saliency detection has been a desirable way for robotic vision to find the most noticeable objects in a scene. In this paper, a robust manifold-based saliency estimation method has been developed to help capture the most salient objects in front of robotic eyes, namely cameras. In the proposed approach, an image is considered as a manifold of visual signals (stimuli) spreading over a connected grid, and local visual stimuli are compared against the global image variation to model the visual saliency. With this model, manifold learning is then applied to minimize the local variation while keeping the global contrast, and turns the RGB image into a multi-channel image. After the projection through manifold learning, histogram-based contrast is then computed for saliency modeling of all channels of the projected images, and mutual information is introduced to evaluate each single-channel saliency map against prior knowledge to provide cues for the fusion of multiple channels. In the last step, the fusion procedure combines all single-channel saliency maps according to their mutual information score, and generates the final saliency map. In our experiment, the proposed method is evaluated using one of the largest publicly available image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency detection methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates. Furthermore, the proposed method is tested on a video-type test dataset where a moving camera is trying to catch up with the walking person---a salient object in the video sequence. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can successful accomplish this task, revealing its potential use for similar robotic applications.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5068/5364,Visual Saliency; Manifold Learning; Object Tracking
281,2012,Robotics,Catch Me If You Can: Pursuit and Capture in Polygonal Environments with Obstacles,"Kyle Klein, Subhash Suri","We resolve a several-years old open question in visibility-based pursuit evasion: how many pursuers are needed to capture an evader in an arbitrary polygonal environment with obstacles? The evader is assumed to be adversarial, moves with the same maximum speed as pursuers, and is ""sensed'' by a pursuer only when it lies inline-of-sight of that pursuer. The players move in discrete time steps, and the capture occurs when a pursuer reaches the position of the evader on its move. Our main result is that O(√h + log n) pursuers can always win the game with a deterministic search strategy in any polygon with n vertices and h obstacles (holes). In order to achieve this bound, however, we argue that the environment must satisfy a minimum feature size property, which essentially requires the minimum distance between any two vertices to be of the same order as the speed of the players. Without the minimum feature size assumption, we show that Ω < ( √(n/log n)) pursuers are needed in the worst-case even for simply-connected (hole-free) polygons of n vertices!  This reveals an unexpected subtlety that seems to have been overlookedin previous work claiming that O(log n) pursuers can always win insimply-connected n-gons.  Our lower bound also shows that capturing an evader is inherently more difficult than just ""seeing"" it because O(log n) pursuers are provably sufficient for line-of-sight detection even against an arbitrarily fast evaderin simple n-gons.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4889/5365,Pursuit evasion; Localization; Motion and Path Planning

These techniques take advantage of local interactions and coordination. In this paper, we propose an approach based on an interaction-oriented resolution of decentralized decision makers. To this end, distributed value functions (DVF) have been used by decoupling the multi-agent problem into a set of individual agent problems. However existing DVF techniques assume permanent and free communication between the agents. In this paper, we extend the DVF methodology to address full local observability, limited share of information and communication breaks. We apply our new DVF in a real-world application consisting of multi-robot exploration where each robot computes locally a strategy that minimizes the interactions between the robots and maximizes the space coverage of the team even under communication constraints. Our technique has been implemented and evaluated in simulation and in real-world scenarios during a robotic challenge for the exploration and mapping of an unknown environment.

However, in many navigation tasks including trajectory planning, surveillance, and coverage, accurate maps are essential for the effective behavior of the robot.  In this paper we present a probabilistic grid-based approach for modeling changing environments. Our method represents both, the occupancy and its changes in the corresponding area where the dynamics are characterized by the state transition probabilities of a Hidden Markov Model. We apply an offline and an online technique to learn the parameters from observed data. The advantage of the online approach is that it can dynamically adapt the parameters and at the same time does not require storing the complete observation sequences.  Experimental results obtained with data acquired by real robots demonstrate that our model is well-suited for representing changing environments.

In the symmetric version of this problem, the robots are required to execute the same strategy. First, we present a symmetric rendezvous strategy for the robots that are initially placed on the open plane and analyze its competitive performance. We show that the competitive complexity of our strategy is O(d/R) where d is the initial distance between the robots and R is the communication radius. Second, we extend the symmetric rendezvous strategy for the open plane to unknown environments with polygonal obstacles. The extended strategy guarantees a complete coverage of the environment. We analyze the strategy for square, translating robots and show that the competitive ratio of the extended strategy is O(d/D) where D is the length of the sides of the robots.

By using MI as the registration criterion, our method is able to work in situ without the need for any specific calibration targets, which makes it practical for in-field calibration. The calibration parameters are estimated by maximizing the mutual information obtained between the sensor-measured surface intensities. We calculate the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound (CRLB) and show that the sample variance of the estimated parameters  empirically approaches the CRLB for a sufficient number of views. Furthermore, we compare the calibration results to independent ground-truth and observe that the mean error also empirically approaches to zero as the number of views are increased. This indicates that the proposed  algorithm, in the limiting case, calculates a minimum variance unbiased (MVUB) estimate of the calibration parameters. Experimental results are presented for data collected by a vehicle mounted with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera system.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5029/5371,"Computer Vision, Calibration, Sensor Fusion"

Usually, the performance of exploration strategies used to decide where to go next is not compared against the optimal performance obtainable in the test environments, because the latter is generally unknown. In this paper, we present a method to calculate an approximation of the optimal (shortest) exploration path in an arbitrary environment. We consider a mobile robot with limited visibility, discretize a two-dimensional environment with a regular grid, and formulate a search problem for finding the optimal exploration path in the grid, which is solved using A*. Experimental results show the viability of our approach for realistically large environments and its potential for better assessing the performance of on-line exploration strategies.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5043/5372,

In this work, we focus on mobile robots that need human assistance at specific spatially-situated locations (e.g., to push buttons in an elevator or to make coffee in the kitchen). We address the problem of what the robot should do when there are no humans present at such help locations. As the robots are mobile, we argue that they should plan to proactively seek help and travel to offices or occupied locations to bring people to the help locations. Such planning involves many trade-offs, including the wait time at the help location before seeking help, and the time and potential interruption to find and displace someone in an office. In order to choose appropriate parameters to represent such decisions, we first conduct a survey to understand potential helpers' travel preferences in terms of distance, interruptibility, and frequency of providing help. We then use these results to contribute a decision-theoretic algorithm  to evaluate the possible choices in offices and plan where to proactively seek help. We demonstrate that our algorithm aims to minimize the number of office interruptions as well as task completion time.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/5141/5373,Asking for help; Human-Robot Interaction; Robotics

We show that our approach is able to search the Web to infer the probability that an object, such as a ""coffee,'' can be found in a location, such as a ""kitchen.''  Our approach, called ObjectEval, is able to dynamically instantiate a utility function using this probability, enabling robots to find arbitrary objects in indoor environments.

An efficient variant of the iterative closest points algorithm allows for registering maps in real-time on a CPU. Our approach learns full-view models of objects in a probabilistic optimization framework in which we find the best alignment between multiple views. Finally, we track the pose of the camera with respect to the learned model by registering the current sensor view to the model.

We leverage an online star clustering algorithm coupled with an incremental belief update in an evolving undirected graphical model. The fusion of these techniques allows the robot to parse streamed data and to continually improve its understanding of the world. The core competency produced is an ability to infer object classes from similarities based on appearance and shape features, and to concurrently combine that with a spatial smoothing algorithm incorporating geometric consistency. This formulation of feature-space star clustering modulating the potentials of a spatial graphical model is entirely novel. In our method, the two sources of information: feature similarity and geometrical consistency are fed continu- ally into the system, improving the belief over the class distributions as new data arrives. The algorithm obviates the need for hand-labeled training data and makes no apriori assumptions on the number or characteristics of object categories. Rather, they are learnt incrementally over time from streamed input data. In experiments per- formed on real 3D laser data from an outdoor scene, we show that our approach is capable of obtaining an ever- improving unsupervised scene categorization.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4998/5376,unsupervised learning; online learning; probabilistic graphical models

The problem of exploring/finding the different homotopy classes in an environment and the problem of finding least-cost paths restricted to a specific homotopy class (or not belonging to certain homotopy classes) arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for unpredictable entities and deployment of multiple agents for efficient exploration of an environment. In [Bhattacharya, Kumar, Likhachev, AAAI 2010] we have shown how homotopy classes of trajectories on a two-dimensional plane with obstacles can be classified and identified using the Cauchy Integral Theorem and the Residue Theorem from Complex Analysis. In more recent work [Bhattacharya, Likhachev, Kumar, RSS 2011] we extended this representation to three-dimensional spaces by exploiting certain laws from the Theory of Electromagnetism (Biot-Savart law and Ampere's Law) for representing and identifying homotopy classes in three dimensions in an efficient way. Using such a representation, we showed that homotopy class constraints can be seamlessly weaved into graph search techniques for determining optimal path constrained to certain homotopy classes or forbidden from others, as well as for exploring different homotopy classes in an environment.

USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success, and efforts are underway to test it in the port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior - to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT's efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model.

To achieve high recognition performance in spontaneous meeting speech, we have investigated an efficient training scheme with minimal supervision which can exploit a huge amount of real data. Specifically, we have proposed a lightly-supervised training scheme based on statistical language model transformation, which fills the gap between faithful transcripts of spoken utterances and final texts for documentation. Once this mapping is trained, we no longer need faithful transcripts for training both acoustic and language models. Instead, we can fully exploit the speech and text data available in Parliament as they are. This scheme also realizes a sustainable ASR system which evolves, i.e. update/re-train the models, only with speech and text generated during the system operation. The ASR system has been deployed in the Japanese Parliament since 2010, and consistently achieved character accuracy of nearly 90\%, which is useful for streamlining the transcription process.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-12/paper/viewFile/4867/5432,"Parliament, Transcription, Speech Recognition"

315,2012,Deployed Track,Using AI Local Search to Improve an OR Optimizer,"Filipa Morgado, Ricardo L. Saldanha, Jorge Roussado, Luis Albino, Ernesto Morgado, Joao P. Martins","One of the key issues for transportation companies is to produce an optimal plan for the work of crew members. Crew planning consists of a sequence of phases, the first two corresponding to planning duties (sequences of trips to be done by crew members from their home base to their home base) and planning rosters (sequences of duties and rest days to be followed by crew members during a certain number of weeks). Both duty and roster planning are subject to a large number of constraints. Duty planning is constrained by intra-duty constraints and roster planning by inter-duty constraints. Since inter-duty constraints relate how duties can be combined into a roster, it is desirable that some of these constraints be transposed into the duty planning phase, as additional constraints, to guarantee that the duties produced in the first phase are ""rosterable'' in the second phase. Both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) have addressed duty planning, but for very large scale problems, OR has been far more successful due to its global vision of the problem. This paper discusses the use of AI local search to improve an OR-based duty planning optimizer that uses additional constraints.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-12/paper/viewFile/4797/5434,

It is very challenging to achieve differentiated instruction in classrooms with class sizes and student diversity of such great magnitude. Professors can only assess whether students have mastered a concept by using multiple choice questions, while detailed homework assignments, such as planar truss diagrams, are rarely assigned because professors and teaching assistants would be too overburdened with grading to return assignments with valuable feedback in a timely manner. In this paper, we introduce Mechanix, a sketch-based deployed tutoring system for engineering students enrolled in statics courses. Our system not only allows students to enter planar truss and free body diagrams into the system just as they would with pencil and paper, but our system checks the student's work against a hand-drawn answer entered by the instructor, and then returns immediate and detailed feedback to the student. Students are allowed to correct any errors in their work and resubmit until the entire content is correct and thus all of the objectives are learned. Since Mechanix facilitates the grading and feedback processes, instructors are now able to assign free response questions, increasing teacher's knowledge of student comprehension. Furthermore, the iterative correction process allows students to learn during a test, rather than simply displaying memorized information.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-12/paper/viewFile/4857/5436,sketch recognition; artificial intelligence; statics; education; engineering education

This paper demonstrates how constraint programming technology can enable automation of the design methodology support when the design artifacts reside in a central repository. At any phase of the design, the proposed constraint programming application can indicate whether the design process data complies with the methodology and point out any violations that may exist.

These representations can be used to perform spatial analogies between sketches, which determine qualitative similarities and differences.  However, there are cases where including quantitative information is necessary for accurately representing a sketch.  We describe a method for using quantitative information to constrain qualitative spatial analogies.  The utility of this method is demonstrated in the context of a sketch-based educational software system.  Importantly, using quantitative information to improve analogical matches is not domain-specific.  It can be used in any situation where qualitative and quantitative spatial information must be combined to accurately interpret a sketch.

POMDPs have been successfully applied to non-ITS domains but, until recently, have seemed intractable for large-scale intelligent tutoring challenges. New, ITS-specific representations leverage common regularities in intelligent tutoring to make a POMDP practical as a learner model. Inquiry modeling is a novel paradigm for informing learner models by observing rich features of learners’ help requests such as categorical content, context, and timing. The experiment described in this paper demonstrates that inquiry modeling and planning with POMDPs can yield significant and substantive learning improvements in a realistic, scenario-based training task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-12/paper/viewFile/4838/5441,Intelligent tutoring system; Adaptive trainer; POMDP

The high dimension of this problem and the nonlinear nature of gravitational interactions make the geometry of these sets complicated, hard to compute, and all but impossible to visualize. Currently, exploration of a problem’s state space is done heuristically, based on previously identified solutions. This potentially misses out on improved mission design solutions that are not close to previous approaches. The goal of the work described here is to map out reachability sets automatically. This would not only aid human mission planners, but also allow a spacecraft to determine its own course without input from Earth-based controllers. Brute-force approaches to this are computationally prohibitive, so one must focus the effort on regions that are of interest: where neighboring trajectories diverge quickly, for instance, or come close to a body that the spacecraft is orbiting. In this paper, we focus on the first of those two criteria; the goal is to identify regions in the system’s state space where small changes have large effects— or vice versa—and concentrate the computational mesh accordingly.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-12/paper/viewFile/4831/5443,Temporal or Geo-Spatial Reasoning; Autonomous Vehicles; Embedded Systems

This method was first evaluated on historical data from a large online dating site and then trialled live on the same site by providing recommendations to a large number of users throughout a 9 week period.

Individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences. Current systems do not distinguish among the users. We introduce a method to combine machine learning algorithms with demographic information and expert advice into existing automated assistive systems. This method can save on the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This method sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While accepted packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers' behavior, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers' demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types.

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, causing more deaths than all types of cancers combined. Early diagnosis of heart disease in women is harder than it is in men and typically requires the administration of several clinical tests on the patient. Most risk stratification methods aggregate the results of such tests, including the risky, invasive procedures that cannot be administered on all patients. In this paper, our goal is to identify patients who are under high-risk of having heart disease and related adverse events, using a minimal number of diagnostic tests, especially less invasive ones. The low frequency of patients with severe heart disease in the dataset is challenging for most conventional machine learning methods. To overcome this problem, we develop and apply a cost-sensitive k nearest neighbor algorithm. Our contributions are two fold: First, we compare the predictive value of several diagnostic procedures for heart disease, including electrocardiography, angiography, radionuclide perfusion and conclude that in womens heart disease, certain combinations of non-invasive techniques are more predictive than some of the widely used invasive procedures. Then, we evaluate held out data and achieve an AUROC over 0.70, signifying valuable clinical utility, using only the least costly and least invasive tests.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-12/paper/viewFile/4848/5450,"cost-sensitive learning, clinical diagnosis, heart disease, imbalanced data"

Johnson, Christopher Kiekintveld, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Tuomas Sandholm, Milind Tambe, John P. Sullivan","In proof-of-payment transit systems, passengers are legally required to purchase tickets before entering but are not physically forced to do so. Instead, patrol units move about the transit system, inspecting the tickets of passengers, who face fines if caught fare evading. The deterrence of such fines depends on the unpredictability and effectiveness of the patrols. In this paper, we present TRUSTS, an application for scheduling randomized patrols for fare inspection in transit systems. TRUSTS models the problem of computing patrol strategies as a leader-follower Stackelberg game where the objective is to deter fare evasion and hence maximize revenue. This problem differs from previously studied Stackelberg settings in that the leader strategies must satisfy massive temporal and spatial constraints; moreover, unlike in these counterterrorism-motivated Stackelberg applications, a large fraction of the ridership might realistically consider fare evasion, and so the number of followers is potentially huge. A third key novelty in our work is deliberate simplification of leader strategies to make patrols easier to be executed. We present an efficient algorithm for computing such patrol strategies and present experimental results using real-world ridership data from the Los Angeles Metro Rail system.

340,2012,Doctoral Consortium,Capabilities in Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems,Jennifer Elisabeth Buehler,"Groups of robots are often able to to accomplish missions that no single robot can achieve by themselves. Teamwork is a very important factor in complex, dynamic domains. In heterogeneous teams, robustness and flexibility are increased by the diversity of the robots, each contributing different capabilities. In such heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems it is reasonable to explicitly take the robots' capabilities into account when determining which one is best suited for a task. In this paper I present a framework that formalizes robots' capabilities and provides a means to estimate their suitability for a task. In highly unpredictable domains, accurate predictions of the outcomes of a robot's actions are virtually impossible. Approximate models and algorithms are required which help to estimate the outcome with highest possible confidence.

An automated agent can use heuristic search to construct a plan that, when executed, will achieve a desired task. The search algorithm explores different sequences of actions that the agent can execute, looking for a sequence that will lead it to a desired goal state. In many situations, an agent is given a task that it would like to solve as quickly as possible. The agent must allocate its time between searching for the actions that will achieve the task and actually executing them.

I am designing a semantic architecture that enables chatter bots to hold short conversations, where context is maintained throughout the exchange. I leverage specific ideas from conversation theory, speech acts theory, and knowledge representation. My architecture models a conversation as a stochastic process that flows through a set of states.

I propose the following answer to the question. The agent should employ an optimal abductive reasoning algorithm (developed piece-wise and shown to be best in a class of similar algorithms) that allows it to reason from evidence to causes. For the sake of efficiency and operational concerns, the agent should establish beliefs periodically rather than waiting until it has obtained all evidence it will ever be able to obtain. If the agent commits to beliefs on the basis of incomplete or noisy evidence or an incomplete knowledge base, these beliefs may be incorrect. Future evidence obtained by the agent may result in failed predictions or anomalies. The agent is then tasked with determining whether it should retain its beliefs and therefore discount the newly-obtained evidence, revise its prior beliefs, or expand its knowledge base (what can be described as anomaly-driven or explanation-based learning). I have developed an abductive metareasoning procedure that aims to appropriately reason about these situations.

351,2012,Doctoral Consortium,Complex Task Learning from Unstructured Demonstrations,Scott Niekum,"Much work in learning from demonstration has focused on learning simple tasks from structured demonstrations that have a well-defined beginning and end. As we attempt to scale robot learning to increasingly complex tasks, it becomes intractable to learn task policies monolithically. Furthermore, it is desirable to be able to learn from natural, unstructured demonstrations, which are unsegmented, possibly incomplete, and may come from different tasks. We propose a three-part approach to designing a natural, scalable system that allows a robot to learn tasks of increasing complexity by automatically building and refining a library of skills over time. First, we describe a Bayesian nonparametric model that can segment unstructured demonstrations into appropriate numbers of component skills and recognize repeated skills across demonstrations and tasks. These skills can then be parameterized and generalized to new situations. Second, we propose to create a system that allows the user to provide unstructured corrections and feedback to the robot, without requiring any knowledge of the robot's underlying representation of the task or its component skills. Third, we propose to infer the user's intentions for each segmented skill and autonomously improve these skills using reinforcement learning. This approach will be applied to learn and generalize complex, multi-step tasks that are beyond the reach of current LfD methods, using the PR2 mobile manipulator as a testing platform.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4766/5291,

Goldman, Ya'akov Gal",This paper addresses the problem of automated advice provision in settings that involve repeated interactions between people and computer agents. This problem arises in many real world applications such as route selection systems and office assistants. To succeed in such settings agents must reason about how their actions in the present influence people's future actions. The paper describes several possible models of human behavior that were inspired by behavioral economic theories of people's play in repeated interactions. These models were incorporated into several agent designs to repeatedly generate offers to people playing the game. These agents were evaluated in extensive empirical investigations including hundreds of subjects that interacted with computers in different choice selections processes. The results revealed that an agent that combined a hyperbolic discounting model of human behavior with a social utility function was able to outperform alternative agent designs. We show that this approach was able to generalize to new people as well as choice selection processes that were not used for training. Our results demonstrate that combining computational approaches with behavioral economics models of people in repeated interactions facilitates the design of advice provision strategies for a large class of real-world settings.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4744/5394,"multiagent systems, human-computer interaction"

To address this, we propose a distributed, model-free algorithm for learning Dec-POMDP policies, in which agents take turns learning, with each agent not currently learning following a static policy.  For agents that have not yet learned a policy, this static policy must be initialized. We propose a principled method for learning such initial policies through interaction with the environment.

We define a set of fairness properties that should be ideally satisfied by a crowdsourcing mechanism. We prove that no mechanism can satisfy all these properties simultaneously.

The final experimental results show our approach achieves promising results on different transformation scenarios.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4757/5419,
380,2012,Student Abstracts,Combining Probabilistic Planning and Logic Programming on Mobile Robots,"Shiqi Zhang, Forrest Sheng Bao, Mohan Sridharan","Key challenges to widespread deployment of mobile robots to interact with humans in real-world domains include the ability to: (a) robustly represent and revise domain knowledge; (b) autonomously adapt sensing and processing to the task at hand; and (c) learn from unreliable high-level human feedback. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been used to plan sensing and navigation in different application domains. It is however a challenge to include common sense knowledge obtained from sensory or human inputs in POMDPs. In addition, information extracted from sensory and human inputs may have varying levels of relevance to current and future tasks. On the other hand, although a non-monotonic logic programming paradigm such as Answer Set Programming (ASP) is wellsuited for common sense reasoning, it is unable to model the uncertainty in real-world sensing and navigation (Gelfond 2008). This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates ASP, hierarchical POMDPs (Zhang and Sridharan 2012) and psychophysics principles to address the challenges stated above. Experimental results in simulation and on mobile robots deployed in indoor domains show that the framework results in reliable and efficient operation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4799/5420,
381,2012,Student Abstracts,Matching State-Based Sequences with Rich Temporal Aspects,"Aihua Zheng, Jixin Ma, Jin Tang, Bin Luo","A General Similarity Measurement (GSM), which takes into account of both non-temporal and rich temporal aspects including temporal order, temporal duration and temporal gap, is proposed for state-sequence matching. It is believed to be versatile enough to subsume representative existing measurements as its special cases.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4790/5421,
