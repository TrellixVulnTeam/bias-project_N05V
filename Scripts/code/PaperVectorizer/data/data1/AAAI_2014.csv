0,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,TopicMF: Simultaneously Exploiting Ratings and Reviews for Recommendation,"Yang Bao, Hui Fang, Jie Zhang","Although users' preference is semantically reflected in the free-form review texts, this wealth of information was not fully exploited for learning recommender models. Specifically, almost all existing recommendation algorithms only exploit rating scores in order to find users' preference, but ignore the review texts accompanied with rating information. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model (called TopicMF) which simultaneously considers the ratings and accompanied review texts. Experimental results on 22 real-world datasets show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness for recommendation tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8273/8391,
1,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Context-Aware Collaborative Topic Regression with Social Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems,"Chaochao Chen, Xiaolin Zheng, Yan Wang, Fuxing Hong, Zhen Lin","Online social networking sites have become popular platforms on which users can link with each other and share information, not only basic rating information but also information such as contexts, social relationships, and item contents. However, as far as we know, no existing works systematically combine diverse types of information to build more accurate recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware hierarchical Bayesian method. First, we propose the use of spectral clustering for user-item subgrouping, so that users and items in similar contexts are grouped. We then propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that can make predictions for each user-item subgroup, our model incorporate not only topic modeling to mine item content but also social matrix factorization to handle ratings and social relationships. Experiments on an Epinions dataset show that our method significantly improves recommendation performance compared with six categories of state-of-the-art recommendation methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and recall. We have also conducted experiments to study the extent to which ratings, contexts, social relationships, and item contents contribute to recommendation performance in terms of prediction accuracy and recall.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8138/8392,recommender systems; matrix factorization; social network; context-aware

In this paper, we propose an approach of entity search by formalizing both context matching and category matching. In addition, we propose a result re-ranking strategy that can be easily adapted to achieve a hybrid of two context matching strategies. Experiments on the INEX 2009 entity ranking task show that the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement of the entity search performance (xinfAP from 0.27 to 0.39) over the existing solutions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8227/8393,entity search; language model

In contrast to existing methods, we propose a novel approach that treats machine translation as a web search task and utilizes the web on the fly to acquire translation knowledge. This end-to-end approach takes advantage of fresh web search results that are capable of leveraging tremendous web knowledge to obtain phrase-level candidates on demand and then compose sentence-level translations. Experimental results show that our web-based machine translation method demonstrates very promising performance in leveraging fresh translation knowledge and making translation decisions. Furthermore, when combined with offline models, it significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8213/8394,
4,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Leveraging Decomposed Trust in Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Effective Recommendation,"Hui Fang, Yang Bao, Jie Zhang","Trust has been used to replace or complement rating-based similarity in recommender systems, to improve the accuracy of rating prediction. However, people trusting each other may not always share similar preferences. In this paper, we try to fill in this gap by decomposing the original single-aspect trust information into four general trust aspects, i.e. benevolence, integrity, competence, and predictability, and further employing the support vector regression technique to incorporate them into the probabilistic matrix factorization model for rating prediction in recommender systems. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8271/8395,
5,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Influence Maximization with Novelty Decay in Social Networks,"Shanshan Feng, Xuefeng Chen, Gao Cong, Yifeng Zeng, Yeow Meng Chee, Yanping Xiang","Influence maximization problem is to find a set of seed nodes in a social network such that their influence spread is maximized under certain propagation models. A few algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem. However, they have not considered the impact of novelty decay on influence propagation, i.e., repeated exposures will have diminishing influence on users. In this paper, we consider the problem of influence maximization with novelty decay (IMND). We investigate the effect of novelty decay on influence propagation on real-life datasets and formulate the IMND problem. We further analyze the problem properties and propose an influence estimation technique. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on four social networks.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8485/8396,social networks; influence maximization; novelty decay

Traditional tools for graph clustering, such asspectral methods, typically suffer from high time and space complexity. In thisarticle, we present  CoreCluster, an efficient  graph clusteringframework based on the concept of graph degeneracy, that can be used  along withany known graph clustering algorithm. Our approach capitalizes on processing thegraph in a hierarchical manner provided by its core expansion sequence, anordered partition of the graph into different levels according to the k-coredecomposition. Such a partition provides a way to process the graph inan incremental manner that preserves its clustering structure, whilemaking the execution of the chosen clustering algorithm much faster due to thesmaller size of the graph's partitions onto which the algorithm operates.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8530/8397,Graph clustering; Community detection; Graph degeneracy; Graph mining
7,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Experiments on Visual Information Extraction with the Faces of Wikipedia,"Md. Kamrul Hasan, Christopher Joseph Pal","We present a series of visual information extraction experiments using the Faces of Wikipedia database - a new resource that we release into the public domain for both recognition and extraction research containing over 50,000 identities and 60,000 disambiguated images of faces. We compare different techniques for automatically extracting the faces corresponding to the subject of a Wikipedia biography within the images appearing on the page. Our top performing approach is based on probabilistic graphical models and uses the text of Wikipedia pages, similarities of faces as well as various other features of the document, meta-data and image files. Our method resolves the problem jointly for all detected faces on a page. While our experiments focus on extracting faces from Wikipedia biographies, our approach is easily adapted to other types of documents and multiple documents. We focus on Wikipedia because the content is a Creative Commons resource and we provide our database to the community including registered faces, hand labeled and automated disambiguations, processed captions, meta data and evaluation protocols. Our best probabilistic extraction pipeline yields an expected average accuracy of 77\% compared to image only and text only baselines which yield 63\% and 66\% respectively.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8570/8398,visual information extraction ; data mining ; probabilistic models
8,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Online Social Spammer Detection,"Xia Hu, Jiliang Tang, Huan Liu","The explosive use of social media also makes it a popular platform for malicious users, known as social spammers, to overwhelm normal users with unwanted content. One effective way for social spammer detection is to build a classifier based on content and social network information. However, social spammers are sophisticated and adaptable to game the system with fast evolving content and network patterns. First, social spammers continually change their spamming content patterns to avoid being detected. Second, reflexive reciprocity makes it easier for social spammers to establish social influence and pretend to be normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of ""human"" friends. It is challenging for existing anti-spamming systems based on batch-mode learning to quickly respond to newly emerging patterns for effective social spammer detection. In this paper, we present a general optimization framework to collectively use content and network information for social spammer detection, and provide the solution for efficient online processing. Experimental results on Twitter datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8467/8399,social spammer; online learning; spam; social media; social networks
9,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,User Group Oriented Temporal Dynamics Exploration,"Zhiting Hu, Junjie Yao, Bin Cui","Temporal online content becomes the zeitgeist to reflect our interests and changes. Active users are essential participants and promoters behind it. Temporal dynamics becomes a viable way to investigate users. However, most current work only use global temporal trend and fail to distinguish such fine-grained patterns across groups. Different users have diverse interest and exhibit distinct behaviors, and temporal dynamics tend to be different. This paper proposes GrosToT (Group Specific Topics-over-Time), a unified probabilistic model to infer latent user groups and temporal topics at the same time. It models group-specific temporal topic variation from social content. By leveraging the comprehensive group-specific temporal patterns, GrosToT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art dynamics modeling methods. Our proposed approach shows advantage not only in temporal dynamics but also group content modeling. The dynamics over different groups vary, reflecting the groups' intention. GrosToT uncovers the interplay between group interest and temporal dynamics. Specifically, groups' attention to their medium-interested topics are event-driven, showing rich bursts; while its engagement in group's dominating topics are interest-driven, remaining stable over time.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8398/8400,
10,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Predicting Emotions in User-Generated Videos,"Yu-Gang Jiang, Baohan Xu, Xiangyang Xue","User-generated video collections are expanding rapidly in recent years, and systems for automatic analysis of these collections are in high demands. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to recognizing semantics like ""birthday party"" and ""skiing"", little attempts have been made to understand the emotions carried by the videos, e.g., ""joy"" and ""sadness"". In this paper, we propose a comprehensive computational framework for predicting emotions in user-generated videos. We first introduce a rigorously designed dataset collected from popular video-sharing websites with manual annotations, which can serve as a valuable benchmark for future research. A large set of features are extracted from this dataset, ranging from popular low-level visual descriptors, audio features, to high-level semantic attributes. Results of a comprehensive set of experiments indicate that combining multiple types of features---such as the joint use of the audio and visual clues---is important, and attribute features such as those containing sentiment-level semantics are very effective.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8402/8401,

Pan, Shonali Krishnaswamy, Wudhichart Sawangphol, Yuan-Fang Li","For expressive ontology languages such as OWL 2 DL, classification is a computationally expensive task—2NEXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Hence, it is highly desirable to be able to accurately estimate classification time, especially for large and complex ontologies. Recently, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to predicting the reasoning hardness category for a given (ontology, reasoner) pair. In this paper, we further develop predictive models to estimate actual classification time using regression techniques, with ontology metrics as features. Our large-scale experiments on 6 state-of-the-art OWL 2 DL reasoners and more than 450 significantly diverse ontologies demonstrate that the prediction models achieve high accuracy, good generalizability and statistical significance. Such prediction models have a wide range of applications. We demonstrate how they can be used to efficiently and accurately identify performance hotspots in a large and complex ontology, an otherwise very time-consuming and resource-intensive task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8305/8402,ontology; reasoning; prediction; performance hotspots
12,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Towards Scalable Exploration of Diagnoses in an Ontology Stream,Freddy Lecue,"Diagnosis, or the process of identifying the nature and cause of an anomaly in an ontology, has been largely studied by the Semantic Web community. In the context of ontology stream, diagnosis results are not captured by a unique fixed ontology but numerous time-evolving ontologies. Thus any anomaly can be diagnosed by a large number of different explana- tions depending on the version and evolution of the ontology. We address the problems of identifying, representing, exploiting and exploring the evolution of diagnoses representations. Our approach consists in a graph-based representation, which aims at (i) efficiently organizing and linking time-evolving di- agnoses and (ii) being used for scalable exploration. The ex- periments have shown scalable diagnoses exploration in the context of real and live data from Dublin City.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8194/8403,knowledge evolution; ontology stream; reasoning; diagnosis; scalable exploration
13,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,ARIA: Asymmetry Resistant Instance Alignment,"Sanghoon Lee, Seung-won Hwang","We study the problem of instance alignment between knowledge bases (KBs). Existing approaches, exploiting the “symmetry” of structure and information across KBs, suffer in the presence of asymmetry, which is frequent as KBs are independently built. Specifically, we observe three types of asymmetries (in concepts, in features, and in structures). Our goal is to identify key techniques to reduce accuracy loss caused by each type of asymmetry, then design Asymmetry-Resistant Instance Alignment framework (ARIA). ARIA uses two-phased blocking methods considering concept and feature asymmetries, with a novel similarity measure overcoming structure asymmetry. Compared to a state-of-the-art method, ARIA increased precision by 19% and recall by 2%, and decreased processing time by more than 80% in matching large-scale real-life KBs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8164/8404,alignment; matching; resolution; knowledge base
14,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Learning Parametric Models for Social Infectivity in Multi-Dimensional Hawkes Processes,"Liangda Li, Hongyuan Zha","Efficient and effective learning of social infectivity presents a critical challenge in modeling diffusion phenomena in social networks and other applications.Existing methods require substantial amount of event cascades to guarantee the learning accuracy and they only consider time-invariant infectivity.Our paper overcomes those two drawbacks by constructing a more compact model and parameterizing the infectivity using time-varying features, thus dramatically reduces the data requirement, and enables the learning of time-varying infectivity which also takes into account the underlying network topology.We replace the pairwise infectivity in the multidimensional Hawkes processes with linear combinations of those time-varying features, and optimize the associated coefficients with lasso-type of regularization. To efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem, we employ the technique of alternating direction method of multipliers which allows independent updating of the individual coefficients by optimizing a surrogate function upper-bounding the original objective function. On both synthetic and real world data, the proposed method performs better than alternatives in terms of both recovering the hidden diffusion network and predicting the occurrence time of social events.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8583/8405,
15,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Fraudulent Support Telephone Number Identification Based on Co-Occurrence Information on the Web,"Xin Li, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma","""Fraudulent support phones"" refers to the misleading telephone numbers placed on Web pages or other media that claim to provide services with which they are not associated. Most fraudulent support phone information is found on search engine result pages (SERPs), and such information substantially degrades the search engine user experience. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify fraudulent support telephone numbers on the Web based on the co-occurrence relations between telephone numbers that appear on SERPs. We start from a small set of seed official support phone numbers and seed fraudulent numbers. Then, we construct a co-occurrence graph according to the co-occurrence relationships of the telephone numbers that appear on Web pages. Additionally, we take the page layout information into consideration on the assumption that telephone numbers that appear in nearby page blocks should be regarded as more closely related. Finally, we develop a propagation algorithm to diffuse the trust scores of seed official support phone numbers and the distrust scores of the seed fraudulent numbers on the co-occurrence graph to detect additional fraudulent numbers. Experimental results based on over 1.5 million SERPs produced by a popular Chinese commercial search engine indicate that our approach outperforms TrustRank, Anti-TrustRank and Good-Bad Rank algorithms by achieving an AUC value of over 0.90.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8133/8406,
16,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Compact Aspect Embedding for Diversified Query Expansions,"Xiaohua Liu, Arbi Bouchoucha, Alessandro Sordoni, Jian-Yun Nie","Diversified query expansion (DQE) based approaches aim to select a set of expansion terms with less redundancy among them while covering as many query aspects as possible. Recently they have experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness for the task of search result diversification. One challenge faced by existing DQE approaches is how to ensure the aspect coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel method for DQE, called compact aspect embedding, which exploits trace norm regularization to learn a low rank vector space for the query, with each eigenvector of the learnt vector space representing an aspect, and the absolute value of its corresponding eigenvalue representing the association strength of that aspect to the query. Meanwhile, each expansion term is mapped into the vector space as well. Based on this novel representation of the query aspects and expansion terms, we design a greedy selection strategy to choose a set of expansion terms to explicitly cover all possible aspects of the query.We test our method on several TREC diversification data sets, and show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art search result diversification approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8350/8407,query expansion; aspect embedding

Given appropriate auxiliary data, researchers have proposed many transfer learning models. How to find such auxiliary data, however, is of little research so far. In this paper, we focus on the problem of auxiliary data retrieval, and propose a transfer learning framework that effectively selects helpful auxiliary data from an open knowledge space (e.g. the World Wide Web). Because there is no need of manually selecting auxiliary data for different target domain tasks, we call our framework Source Free Transfer Learning (SFTL). For each target domain task, SFTL framework iteratively queries for the helpful auxiliary data based on the learned model and then updates the model using the retrieved auxiliary data. We highlight the automatic constructions of queries and the robustness of the SFTL framework. Our experiments on 20NewsGroup dataset and a Google search snippets dataset suggest that the framework is capable of achieving comparable performance to those state-of-the-art methods with dedicated selections of auxiliary data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8361/8409,Transfer Learning;Auxiliary Data Retrieval;Text Classification

Our approach comprises an algorithm that evenly distributes the workload to cores, and an RDF indexing data structure that supports efficient, 'mostly' lock-free parallel updates.

19,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Fast and Accurate Influence Maximization on Large Networks with Pruned Monte-Carlo Simulations,"Naoto Ohsaka, Takuya Akiba, Yuichi Yoshida, Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi","Influence maximization is a problem to find small sets of highly influential individuals in a social network to maximize the spread of influence under stochastic cascade models of propagation. Although the problem has been well-studied, it is still highly challenging to find solutions of high quality in large-scale networks of the day. While Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods produce near-optimal solutions with a theoretical guarantee, they are prohibitively slow for large graphs. As a result, many heuristic methods without any theoretical guarantee have been developed, but all of them substantially compromise solution quality. To address this issue, we propose a new method for the influence maximization problem. Unlike other recent heuristic methods, the proposed method is a Monte-Carlo-simulation-based method, and thus it consistently produces solutions of high quality with the theoretical guarantee. On the other hand, unlike other previous Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods, it runs as fast as other state-of-the-art methods, and can be applied to large networks of the day.

In EBSNs, event recommendation plays a central role in recommending the most relevant events to users who are likely to participate in. Different from traditional recommendation problems, event recommendation encounters three new types of information, i.e., heterogenous online+offline social relationships, geographical features of events and implicit rating data from users. Yet combining the three types of data for offline event recommendation has not been considered. Therefore, we present a Bayesian latent factor model that can unify these data for event recommendation.

21,2014,Main Track: AI and the Web,Stochastic Privacy,"Adish Singla, Eric Horvitz, Ece Kamar, Ryen White","Online services such as web search and e-commerce applications typically rely on the collection of data about users, including details of their activities on the web.  Such personal data is used to maximize revenues via targeting of advertisements and longer engagements of users, and to enhance the quality of service via personalization of content.  To date, service providers have largely followed the approach of either requiring or requesting consent for collecting user data.  Users may be willing to share private information in return for incentives, enhanced services, or assurances about the nature and extent of the logged data. We introduce stochastic privacy, an approach to privacy centering on the simple concept of providing people with a guarantee that the probability that their personal data will be shared does not exceed a given bound. Such a probability, which we refer to as the privacy risk, can be given by users as a preference or communicated as a policy by a service provider.  Service providers can work to personalize and to optimize revenues in accordance with preferences about privacy risk.  We present procedures, proofs, and an overall system for maximizing the quality of services, while respecting bounds on privacy risk.

But these networks are usually isolated from each other. Mapping common users across these social networks will benefit many applications. Methods based on username comparison perform well on parts of users, however they can not work in the following situations: (a) users choose different usernames in different networks; (b) a unique username corresponds to different individuals. In this paper, we propose to utilize social structures to improve the mapping performance. Specifically, a novel subspace learning algorithm, Manifold Alignment on Hypergraph (MAH), is proposed. Different from traditional semi-supervised manifold alignment methods, we use hypergraph to model high-order relations here. For a target user in one network, the proposed algorithm ranks all users in the other network by their possibilities of being the corresponding user. Moreover, methods based on username comparison can be incorporated into our algorithm easily to further boost the mapping accuracy.

However, the derived taxonomies usually contain many mistakenly imported taxonomic relations due to the difference between the user-generated subsumption relations and the semantic taxonomic relations. Current approaches to solving the problem still suffer the following issues: (i) the heuristic-based methods strongly rely on specific language dependent rules. (ii) the corpus-based methods depend on a large-scale high-quality corpus, which is often unavailable. In this paper, we formulate the cross-lingual taxonomy derivation problem as the problem of cross-lingual taxonomic relation prediction. We investigate different linguistic heuristics and language independent features, and propose a cross-lingual knowledge validation based dynamic adaptive boosting model to iteratively reinforce the performance of taxonomic relation prediction.

Given a microblog text which consists of several sentences, we classify its emotion as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, like, sadness or surprise if available. Existing methods can be categorized as lexicon based methods or machine learning based methods. However, due to some intrinsic characteristics of the microblog texts, previous studies using these methods always get unsatisfactory results. This paper introduces a novel approach based on class sequential rules for emotion classification of microblog texts. The approach first obtains two potential emotion labels for each sentence in a microblog text by using an emotion lexicon and a machine learning approach respectively, and regards each microblog text as a data sequence. It then mines class sequential rules from the dataset and finally derives new features from the mined rules for emotion classification of microblog texts.

For example, some pages contain numerous texts, whereas some others contain few texts; some web videos are in high resolution, whereas some other web videos are in low resolution. As a consequence, the quality of extracted features from different web data may also vary greatly. Existing learning algorithms on web data classification usually ignore the variations of information quality or quantity. In this paper, the information quantity and quality of web data are described by quality-related factors such as text length and image quantity, and a new learning method is proposed to train classifiers based on quality-related factors. The method divides training data into subsets according to the clustering results of quality-related factors and then trains classifiers by using a multi-task learning strategy for each subset.

In order to establish a scalable social image analysis system, two issues need to be considered: 1) Supervised learning is a futile task in modeling the enormous number of concepts in the world, whereas unsupervised approaches overcome this hurdle; 2) Algorithms are required to be both spatially and temporally efficient to handle large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a cross-view feature learning (CVFL) framework to handle the problem of social image analysis effectively and efficiently. Through explicitly modeling the relevance between image content and tags (which is empirically shown to be visually and semantically meaningful), CVFL yields more promising results than existing methods in the experiments. More importantly, being general and descriptive, CVFL and its variants can be readily applied to other large-scale multi-view tasks in unsupervised setting.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8462/8421,

Extending the existing speech act framework, we capture common emotional expressions that often appear in student discussions, such as frustration and degree of certainty, and present a viable approach for the classification. We demonstrate how such dialogue information can be used in analyzing student discussions and identifying difficulties. In particular, the difficulty expressions are aligned to discussion patterns and student performance. We found that frustration occurs more frequently in longer discussions. The students who frequently express frustration tend to get lower grades than others. On the other hand, frequency of high certainty expressions is positively correlated with the performance. We expect such online dialogue analyses can become a powerful assessment tool for instructors and education researchers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8331/8422,Difficulty Expressions; Emotional/Information Roles; Discussion Development; Performance Prediction

Most existing summarization approaches use the visual-based features for image representation without considering tag information.In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named JOINT, which employs both image content and tag information to summarize images. Our model generates the summary images which can best reconstruct the original collection. Based on the assumption that an image with representative content should also have typical tags, we introduce a similarity-inducing regularizer to our model.

However, few of existing work studied the direct, microscopic and temporal impact of social influence on people's behaviors in detail. In this paper we concentrate on the behavior modeling and systematically formulate the family of behavior propagation models (BPMs) including the static models (BP and IBP), and their discrete temporal variants (DBP and DIBP). To address the temporal dynamics of behavior propagation over continuous time, we propose a continuous temporal interest-aware behavior propagation model, called CIBP. As a new member of the BPM family, CIBP exploits the continuous-temporal functions (CTFs) to model the fully-continuous dynamic variance of social influence over time.

Orgun, Youliang Zhong, Guanfeng Liu","Online social networks have been used for a variety of rich activities in recent years, such as investigating potential employees and seeking recommendations of high quality services and service providers. In such activities, trust is one of the most critical factors for the decision-making of users. In the literature, the state-of-the-art trust prediction approaches focus on either dispositional trust tendency and propagated trust of the pair-wise trust relationships along a path or the similarity of trust rating values. However, there are other influential factors that should be taken into account, such as the similarity of the trust rating distributions. In addition, tendency, propagated trust and similarity are of different types, as either personal properties or interpersonal properties. But the difference has been neglected in existing models. Therefore, in trust prediction, it is necessary to take all the above factors into consideration in modeling, and process them separately and differently. In this paper we propose a new trust prediction model based on trust decomposition and matrix factorization, considering all the above influential factors and differentiating both personal and interpersonal properties. In this model, we first decompose trust into trust tendency and tendency-reduced trust. Then, based on tendency-reduced trust ratings, matrix factorization with a regularization term is leveraged to predict the tendency-reduced values of missing trust ratings, incorporating both propagated trust and the similarity of users' rating habits. In the end, the missing trust ratings are composed with predicted tendency-reduced values and trust tendency values. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset illustrate significant improvement delivered by our approach in trust prediction accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8368/8426,Trust Prediction; Social Network; Trust Propagation; Trust Tendency

They thus behave similarly to human brain's memory that is capable for instance of retrieving the end of a song given its beginning. Among different families of associative memories, sparse ones are known to provide the best efficiency (ratio of the number of bits stored to that of bits used). Nevertheless, it is well known that non-uniformity of the stored messages can lead to dramatic decrease in performance. Recently, a new family of sparse associative memories achieving almost-optimal efficiency has been proposed. Their structure induces a direct mapping between input messages and stored patterns. In this work, we show the impact of non-uniformity on the performance of this recent model and we exploit the structure of the model to introduce several strategies to allow for efficient storage of non-uniform messages.

In this paper, we demonstrate a method for estimating battery remaining energy using real data collected from the Charge Car electric vehicle. This new method relies on energy integration as an initial estimation step, which is then corrected using a neural net that learns how error accumulates from recent charge/discharge cycles. In this way, the algorithm is able to adapt to nonlinearities and variations that are difficult to model or characterize. On the collected dataset, this method is demonstrated to be accurate to within 2.5% to 5% of battery remaining energy, which equates to approximately 1 to 2 miles of residual range for the Charge Car given its 10kWh battery pack.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8461/8434,electric vehicles; neural networks; battery state estimation; coulomb counting; joule counting

The emotional impact is very important for understanding the intrinsic meanings of images. Despite many studies having been done, most existing methods focus on image content, but ignore the emotion of the user who published the image.  One interesting question is: How does social effect correlate with the emotion expressed in an image? Specifically, can we leverage friends interactions (e.g., discussions) related to an image to help extract the emotions?  In this paper, we formally formalize the problem and propose a novel emotion learning method by jointly modeling images posted by social users and comments added by their friends. One advantage of the model is that it can distinguish those comments that are closely related to the emotion expression for an image from the other irrelevant ones. Experiments on an open Flickr dataset show that the proposed model can significantly improve (+37.4% by F1) the accuracy for inferring user emotions.

In this paper, we study the problem of automatically diagnosing diabetes complications from patients' lab test results. The objective problem has two main challenges: 1) feature sparseness: a patient only undergoes  1.26% lab tests on average, and 65.5% types of lab tests are performed on samples from less than 10 patients; 2) knowledge skewness: it lacks comprehensive detailed domain knowledge of the association between diabetes complications and lab tests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic model called Sparse Factor Graph Model (SparseFGM). SparseFGM projects sparse features onto a lower-dimensional latent space, which alleviates the problem of sparseness. SparseFGM is also able to capture the associations between complications and lab tests, which help handle the knowledge skewness.

In this paper, we explore the use of efficient codes for representing information relevant to human movements during locomotion. Specifically, we apply motion capture data to a physical model of the human skeleton to compute joint angles (inverse kinematics) and joint torques (inverse dynamics); then, by treating the resulting paired dataset as a supervised regression problem, we investigate the effect of sparsity in mapping from angles to torques. The results of our investigation suggest that sparse codes can indeed represent salient features of both the kinematic and dynamic views of human locomotion movements. However, sparsity appears to be only one parameter in building a model of inverse dynamics; we also show that the ""encoding"" process benefits significantly by integrating with the ""regression"" process for this task. In addition, we show that, for this task, simple coding and decoding methods are not sufficient to model the extremely complex inverse dynamics mapping.

But it does not assume the agents have a vocabulary for Boolean functions nor grammatical constructions for expressing such logical combinations of categories through language. The results of the experiments we have performed show that a language system of logical constructions emerges as a result of a process of self-organisation of the individual agents' interactions when these agents adapt their preferences for vocabulary and grammatical constructions to those they observe are used more often by the rest of the population, and that such a language system is transmitted from one generation to the next.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8342/8441,Cognitive Modeling; Symbolic AI;  Simulating Humans; Adaptive Behavior

Yet, the compositional structure of a given domain can be grounded in a separate domain thereby simplifying its learning. To that end, we propose a new approach to modeling bimodal percepts that explicitly relates distinct projections across each modality and then jointly learns a bimodal sparse representation. The resulting model enables compositionality across these distinct projections and hence can generalize to unobserved percepts spanned by this compositional basis. For example, our model can be trained on 'red triangles' and 'blue squares'; yet, implicitly will also have learned 'red squares' and 'blue triangles'. The structure of the projections and hence the compositional basis is learned automatically for a given language model.

59,2014,Main Track: Computational Sustainability and AI,Spatial Scan for Disease Mapping on a Mobile Population,"Liang Lan, Vuk Malbasa, Slobodan Vucetic","In disease mapping, the spatial scan statistic is used to detect spatial regions where population is exposed to a significantly higher disease risk than expected. In this important application, the current residence is typically used to define the location of individuals from the population. Considering the mobility of humans at various temporal and spatial scales, using only information about the current residence may be an insufficiently informative proxy because it ignores a multitude of exposures that may occur away from home, or which had occurred at previous residences. In this paper, we propose a spatial scan statistic that is appropriate for disease mapping on mobile populations. We formulate a computationally efficient algorithm that uses the proposed statistic to find significant high-risk regions from mobile population's disease status data. The algorithm is applicable on large populations and over dense spatial grids. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and outperforms the traditional disease clustering approaches at discovering high-risk regions in mobile populations.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8468/8452,Disease Clustering; Spatial Scan; Mobility Data;

Bruce van Dover","Newly-discovered materials have been central to recent technological advances. They have contributed significantly to breakthroughs in electronics, renewable energy and green buildings, and overall, have promoted the advancement of global human welfare. Yet, only a fraction of all possible materials have been explored. Accelerating the pace of discovery of materials would foster technological innovations, and would potentially address pressing issues in sustainability, such as energy production or consumption. The bottleneck of this discovery cycle lies, however, in the analysis of the materials data. As materials scientists have recently devised techniques to efficiently create thousands of materials and experimentalists have developed new methods and tools to characterize these materials, the limiting factor has become the data analysis itself. Hence, the goal of this paper is to stimulate the development of new computational techniques for the analysis of materials data, by bringing together the complimentary expertise of materials scientists and computer scientists. In collaboration with two major research laboratories in materials science, we provide the first publicly available dataset for the phase map identification problem.

We consider the problem of how to generate scores in a setting where they should be weakly monotone (either non-increasing or non-decreasing) in their dimensions. Our approach allows an expert to score an arbitrary set of points to produce meaningful, continuous, monotone scores over the entire domain, while exactly interpolating through those inputs. In contrast, existing monotone interpolating methods only work in two dimensions and typically require exhaustive grid input.

Jennings","Current electricity tariffs do not reflect the real cost that customers incur to suppliers, as units are charged at the same rate, regardless of how predictable each customer's consumption is. A recent proposal to address this problem are prediction-of-use tariffs. In such tariffs, a customer is asked in advance to predict her future consumption, and is charged based both on her actual consumption and the deviation from her prediction. Prior work {aamas2014} studied the cost game induced by a single such tariff, and showed customers would have an incentive to minimize their risk, by joining together when buying electricity as a grand coalition. In this work we study the efficient (i.e. cost-minimizing) structure of buying groups for the more realistic setting when multiple, competing prediction-of-use tariffs are available.

By mining and analyzing population movements after the Great East Japan Earthquake, our system can automatically learn a probabilistic model to better understand and simulate human mobility during the emergency situations. Based on the learning model, population mobility in various urban areas impacted by the earthquake throughout Japan can be automatically simulated or predicted.

Many of the renewable energy resources do not produce power on demand, and therefore there is a need for new market structures that motivate sustainable behaviors by participants.  The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) is a new annual competition that focuses on the design and operation of future retail power markets, specifically in smart grid environments with renewable energy production, smart metering, and autonomous agents acting on behalf of customers and retailers. It uses a rich, open-source simulation platform that is based on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making, as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. This paper introduces TacTex'13, the champion agent from the inaugural competition in 2013.

The most important of them is the uncoordinated EV charging that substantially increases the energy demand peaks, putting the smart grid under constant strain. In order to cope with these peaks the grid needs extra infrastructure, a costly solution. We propose an Adaptive Management of EV Storage (AMEVS) algorithm, implemented through a learning agent that acts on behalf of individual EV owners and schedules EV charging over a weekly horizon. It accounts for individual preferences so that mobility service is not violated but also individual benefit is maximized. We observe that it reshapes the energy demand making it less volatile so that fewer resources are needed to cover peaks. It assumes Vehicle-to-Grid discharging when the customer has excess capacity. Our agent uses Reinforcement Learning trained on real world data to learn individual household consumption behavior and to schedule EV charging. Unlike previous work, AMEVS is a fully distributed approach. We show that AMEVS achieves significant reshaping of the energy demand curve and peak reduction, which is correlated with customer preferences regarding perceived utility of energy availability. Additionally, we show that the average and peak energy prices are reduced as a result of smarter energy use.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8268/8458,Electric Vehicles;Smart Grid; Optimization; Reinforcement Learning

The underlying model describes phenomena that spread away from the root of a tree, for example, the spread of influence in a hierarchical organization or fish in a river network. Actions can be taken to intervene in the network—for some cost—to increase the probability of propagation along an edge. Our algorithm selects a set of actions to maximize the overall spread in the network under a limited budget. We prove that the algorithm is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS), that is, it finds (1−ε)-optimal solutions in time polynomial in the input size and 1/ε. We apply the algorithm to the problem of allocating funds efficiently to remove barriers in a river network so fish can reach greater portions of their native range.

In the case of eBird, a major cause of poor quality data is the misidentification of bird species by inexperienced contributors. A proactive approach for improving data quality is to discover commonly misidentified bird species and to teach inexperienced birders the differences between these species. To accomplish this goal, we develop a latent variable graphical model that can identify groups of bird species that are often confused for each other by eBird participants. Our model is a multi-species extension of the classic occupancy-detection model in the ecology literature. This multi-species extension requires a structure learning step as well as a computationally expensive parameter learning stage which we make efficient through a variational approximation. We show that our model can not only discover groups of misidentified species, but by including these misidentifications in the model, it can also achieve more accurate predictions of both species occupancy and detection.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8421/8462,Machine Learning; Probabilistic Graphical Model; Citizen Science; Crowdsourcing

For non-trivial versions of our game, stable solutions like Nash Equilibrium may not exist, or may be socially inefficient even when they do exist. This motivates us to focus on designing efficient algorithms to compute (almost) stable solutions like Approximate Equilibrium that can be realized if agents are provided some additional incentives. Our results apply in many settings like adoption of new products, project selection, and group formation, where a central authority can direct agents towards a strategy but agents may defect if they have better alternatives. We show that for any given instance, we can either compute a high quality approximate equilibrium or a near-optimal solution that can be stabilized by providing small payments to some players.

ScenarioGen uses the crowd in three different ways: to capture a database of scenarios of everyday activities, to generate a database of likely replacements for specific events within that scenario, and to evaluate the resulting scenarios. We evaluated ScenarioGen in 6 different content domains and found that it was consistently rated as coherent and consistent as the originally captured content.

This additional expressibility produces benefits that have led to combinatorial auctions becoming extremely important both in practice and in theory. In the computer science community, auction design has focused primarily on computational practicality and incentive compatibility. The latter concerns mechanisms that are resistant to bidders misrepresenting themselves via a single false identity; however, with modern forms of bid submission, such as electronic bidding, other types of cheating have become feasible. Prominent amongst them is false-name bidding; that is, bidding under pseudonyms. For example, the ubiquitous Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is incentive compatible and produces optimal allocations, but it is not false-name-proof–bidders can increase their utility by submitting bids under multiple identifiers. Thus, there has recently been much interest in the design and analysis of false-name-proof auction mechanisms. These false-name-proof mechanisms, however, have polynomially small efficiency guarantees: they can produce allocations with very low economic efficiency/social welfare. In contrast, we show that, provided the degree to which different goods are complementary is bounded (as is the case in many important, practical auctions), the VCG mechanism gives a constant efficiency guarantee. Constant efficiency guarantees hold even at equilibria where the agents bid in a manner that is not individually rational. Thus, while an individual bidder may personally benefit greatly from making false-name bids, this will have only a small detrimental effect on the objective of the auctioneer: maximizing economic efficiency. So, from the auctioneer's viewpoint the VCG mechanism remains preferable to false-name-proof mechanisms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8572/8467,Auctions and Market-Based Systems; Mechanism Design; Equilibrium; E-Commerce

In the absence of majority ties--e.g., when there is an odd number of agents with linear preferences--the majority relation is antisymmetric and complete and can thus conveniently be represented by a tournament. Tournaments have a rich mathematical theory and many formal results for majoritarian functions assume that the majority relation constitutes a tournament. Moreover, most majoritarian functions have only been defined for tournaments and allow for a variety of generalizations to unrestricted preference profiles, none of which can be seen as the unequivocal extension of the original function.

We prove how this can be done by carefully discounting the prior regrets. This provides, to our knowledge, the first principled warm-starting method for no-regret learning. It also extends to warm-starting the widely-adopted counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithm for large incomplete-information games; we show this experimentally as well. We then study optimizing a parameter vector for a player in a two-player zero-sum game (e.g., optimizing bet sizes to use in poker). We propose a custom gradient descent algorithm that provably finds a locally optimal parameter vector while leveraging our warm-start theory to significantly save regret-matching iterations at each step. It optimizes the parameter vector while simultaneously finding an equilibrium. We present experiments in no-limit Leduc Hold'em and no-limit Texas Hold'em to optimize bet sizing.

This work presents the first technique for decomposing an imperfect information game into subgames that can be solved independently, while retaining optimality guarantees on the full-game solution.  We can use this technique to construct theoretically justified algorithms that make better use of information available at run-time, overcome memory or disk limitations at run-time, or make a time/space trade-off to overcome memory or disk limitations while solving a game.

We study different variations of the Vickrey mechanism that take as input the agents' reported distributions and the players' realized running times and that output a schedule that minimizes the expected sum of processing times, as well as payments that make it an ex-post equilibrium for the agents to both truthfully report their distributions and exert full effort to complete the task. We devise the ChPE mechanism, which is uniquely tailored to our problem, and has many desirable properties including: not rewarding agents that fail to finish the task and having non-negative payments.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8162/8479,mechanism design; scheduling; monotone hazard rate distribution; Vickrey mechanism; ex-post truthful; execution uncertainty
87,2014,Main Track: Game Theory and Economic Paradigms,Using Response Functions to Measure Strategy Strength,"Trevor Davis, Neil Burch, Michael Bowling","Extensive-form games are a powerful tool for representing complex multi-agent interactions. Nash equilibrium strategies are commonly used as a solution concept for extensive-form games, but many games are too large for the computation of Nash equilibria to be tractable. In these large games, exploitability has traditionally been used to measure deviation from Nash equilibrium, and thus strategies are aimed to achieve minimal exploitability. However, while exploitability measures a strategy's worst-case performance, it fails to capture how likely that worst-case is to be observed in practice. In fact, empirical evidence has shown that a less exploitable strategy can perform worse than a more exploitable strategy in one-on-one play against a variety of opponents. In this work, we propose a class of response functions that can be used to measure the strength of a strategy. We prove that standard no-regret algorithms can be used to learn optimal strategies for a scenario where the opponent uses one of these response functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in Leduc Hold'em against opponents that use the UCT Monte Carlo tree search algorithm.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8589/8480,strategy evaluation; extensive-form games; adaptive opponents

In our setting, firms compete to maximize their market share in a network of consumers whose adoption decisions are stochastically determined by the choices of their neighbors. Building on the switching-selecting framework introduced by Goyal and Kearns, we first introduce a new model in which the payoff to firms comprises not only the number of vertices who adopt their (competing) technologies, but also the network connectivity among those nodes. For a general class of stochastic dynamics driving the local adoption process, we derive upper bounds on (1) the (pure strategy) Price of Anarchy (PoA), which measures the inefficiency of resource use at equilibrium, and (2) the Budget Multiplier, which captures the extent to which the network amplifies the imbalances in the firms' initial budgets. These bounds depend on the firm budgets and the maximum degree of the network, but no other structural properties. In addition, we give general conditions under which the PoA and the Budget Multiplier can be unbounded. We also introduce a model in which budgeting decisions are endogenous, rather than externally given as is typical in the viral marketing problem. In this setting, the firms are allowed to choose the number of seeds to initially infect (at a fixed cost per seed), as well as which nodes to select as seeds. In sharp contrast to the results of Goyal and Kearns, we show that for almost any local adoption dynamics, there exists a family of graphs for which the PoA and Budget Multiplier are unbounded.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8399/8481,"Competitive Contagion, Price of Anarchy, Connectivity, Endogenous Budget Constraints"

We develop a new model for representing and assessing agent preferences that accommodates both forms of information and (heuristically) minimizes the number of queries and interviews required to determine a stable matching. Our Refine-then-Interview (RtI) scheme uses coarse preference queries to refine knowledge of agent preferences and relies on interviews only to assess comparisons of relatively “close” options.

We then establish a connection between narcissistic elections (where each candidate is ranked first by at least one voter), single-peaked elections and single-crossing elections, by showing that an election is SPSC if and only if it can be obtained from a narcissistic single-crossing election by deleting voters.

Some of these algorithms extend to preferences that are close to having the respective structural property, i.e., can be made to enjoy this property by performing minor changes to voters' preferences, such as deleting a small number of voters or candidates. However, it has recently been shown that finding the optimal number of voters or candidates to delete in order to achieve the desired structural property is NP-hard for many such domains. In this paper, we show that these problems admit efficient approximation algorithms. Our results apply to all domains that can be characterized in terms of forbidden configurations; this includes, in particular, single-peaked and single-crossing elections.

We characterize runoff rules that are based on scoring rules using two axioms: a weakening of local independence of irrelevant alternatives and a variant of population-consistency.

In order to approximate equilibrium strategies in these games, the leading approach is to create a sufficiently small strategic approximation of the full game, called an abstraction, and to solve that smaller game instead. The leading abstraction algorithm for imperfect-information games generates abstractions that have imperfect recall and are distribution aware, using $k$-means with the earth mover's distance metric to cluster similar states together. A distribution-aware abstraction groups states together at a given round if their full distributions over future strength are similar (as opposed to, for example, just the expectation of their strength). The leading algorithm considers distributions over future strength at the final round of the game.  However, one might benefit by considering the trajectory of distributions over strength in all future rounds, not just the final round. An abstraction algorithm that takes all future rounds into account is called potential aware. We present the first algorithm for computing potential-aware imperfect-recall abstractions using earth mover's distance.

As with online advertising, a crucial ingredient for their success is the development of effective economic mechanisms. An important difference is that mobile ads are shown sequentially over time and information about the user can be learned based on their movements. Furthermore, ads need to be shown selectively to prevent ad fatigue. To this end, we introduce, for the first time, a user model and suitable economic mechanisms which take these factors into account. Specifically, we design two truthful mechanisms which produce an advertisement plan based on the user’s movements. One mechanism is allocatively efficient, but requires exponential compute time in the worst case. The other requires polynomial time, but is not allocatively efficient.

This summation principle ensures that all votes contribute equally to the score of an alternative. We relax this assumption and, instead, aggregate scores by taking into account the rank of a score in the ordered list of scores obtained from the votes. This defines a new family of voting rules, rank-dependent scoring rules (RDSRs), based on ordered weighted average (OWA) operators, which, include all scoring rules, and many others, most of which of new.

Under the VCG mechanism, the auctioneer can sometimes increase revenue by “burning” items. We study this phenomenon in a setting where items are described by a number of attributes. The value of an attribute corresponds to a quality level, and bidders’ valuations are non-decreasing in the quality levels. In addition to burning items, we allow the auctioneer to present some of the attributes as lower quality than they actually are.  We consider the following two revenue maximization problems under VCG: finding an optimal way to mark down items by reducing their quality levels, and finding an optimal set of items to burn. We study the effect of the following parameters on the computational complexity of these two problems: the number of attributes, the number of quality levels per attribute, and the complexity of the bidders’ valuation functions. Bidders have unit demand, so VCG’s outcome can be computed in polynomial time, and the valuation functions we consider are step functions that are non-decreasing with the quality levels. We prove that both problems are NP-hard even in the following three simple settings: a) four attributes, arbitrarily many quality levels per attribute, and single-step valuation functions, b) arbitrarily many attributes, two quality levels per attribute, and single-step valuation functions, and c) one attribute, arbitrarily many quality levels, and multi-step valuation functions. For the case where items have only one attribute, and every bidder has a single-step valuation (zero below some quality threshold), we show that both problems can be solved in polynomial-time using a dynamic programming approach. For this case, we also quantify how much better marking down is than item burning, and we compare the revenue of both approaches with computational experiments.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8186/8490,mechanism design; marking down; item burning; revenue maximization; VCG

To handle general elections, one must use a family of vectors, one per length. The most elegant approach to making sure such families are ""family-like'' is the recently introduced notion of (polynomial-time uniform) pure scoring rules, where each scoring vector is obtained from its precursor by adding one new coefficient. We obtain the first dichotomy theorem for pure scoring rules for a control problem. In particular, for constructive control by adding voters (CCAV), we show that CCAV is solvable in polynomial time for k-approval with k<=3, k-veto with k<=2, every pure scoring rule in which only the two top-rated candidates gain nonzero scores, and a particular rule that is a ""hybrid"" of 1-approval and 1-veto. For all other pure scoring rules, CCAV is NP-complete. We also investigate the descriptive richness of different models for defining pure scoring rules, proving how more rule-generation time gives more rules, proving that rationals give more rules than do the natural numbers, and proving that some restrictions previously thought to be ""w.l.o.g."" in fact do lose generality.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8306/8491,voting systems; computational social choice; complexity; scoring rules; control of elections; dichotomy theorems

The mechanism marries auctions, that allow users to report their preferences, with online algorithms, that allow distribution companies to learn user-specific parameters.

The problem asks to select k out of m available items, so as to maximize the social welfare for autonomous agents with combinatorial preferences (valuation functions) over subsets of items. The CPPP constitutes an abstract model for decision making by autonomous agents and has been shown to present severe computational hardness, in the design of truthful approximation mechanisms. We study a non-truthful mechanism that is, however, practically relevant to multi-agent environments, by virtue of its natural simplicity. It employs an Item Bidding interface, wherein every agent issues a separate bid for the inclusion of each distinct item in the outcome; the k items with the highest sums of bids are chosen and agents are charged according to a VCG-based payment rule. For fairly expressive classes of the agents' valuation functions, we establish existence of socially optimal pure Nash and strong equilibria, that are resilient to coordinated deviations of subsets of agents. Subsequently we derive tight worst-case bounds on the approximation of the optimum social welfare achieved in equilibrium. We show that the mechanism's performance improves with the number of agents that can coordinate, and reaches half of the optimum welfare at strong equilibrium.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8336/8496,Mechanism; Social Welfare; Nash Equilibrium; Valuation Function

Vullikanti","The spread of epidemics and malware is commonly modeled by diffusion processes on networks. Protective interventions such as vaccinations or installing anti-virus software are used to contain their spread. Typically, each node in the network has to decide its own strategy of securing itself, and its benefit depends on which other nodes are secure, making this a natural game-theoretic setting. There has been a lot of work on network security game models, but most of the focus has been either on simplified epidemic models or homogeneous network structure. We develop a new formulation for an epidemic containment game, which relies on the characterization of the SIS model in terms of the spectral radius of the network. We show in this model that pure Nash equilibria (NE) always exist, and can be found by a best response strategy. We analyze the complexity of finding NE, and derive rigorous bounds on their costs and the Price of Anarchy or PoA (the ratio of the cost of the worst NE to the optimum social cost) in general graphs as well as in random graph models. In particular, for arbitrary power-law graphs with exponent $\beta>2$, we show that the PoA is bounded by $O(T^{2(\beta-1)})$, where $T=\gamma/\alpha$ is the ratio of the recovery rate to the transmission rate in the SIS model. We prove that this bound is tight up to a constant factor for the Chung-Lu random power-law graph model.

A common strategy is to selectively kick gamblers out, possibly even without being sure that they were cheating. In this paper, we address the following question: Based solely on a gambler’s track record,when is it optimal for the casino to kick the gambler out? Because cheaters will adapt to the casino’s policy, this is a game-theoretic question. Specifically, we model the problem as a Bayesian game in which the casino is a Stackelberg leader that can commit to a (possibly randomized) policy for when to kick gamblers out, and we provide efficient algorithms for computing the optimal policy.

Most existing work assumes that users are homogeneous and have the same ability. However, real-world users are heterogeneous and their abilities can be very different from each other due to their diversity in background, culture, and profession. In this work, we consider the following setting: (1) the users are heterogeneous and each of them has a private type indicating the best quality of the content he/she can generate; (2) all the users share a fixed total reward. With this setting, we study the existence of pure Nash equilibrium of several mechanisms composed by different allocation rules, action spaces, and information availability.

114,2014,Main Track: Game Theory and Economic Paradigms,Game-Theoretic Resource Allocation for Protecting Large Public Events,"Yue Yin, Bo An, Manish Jain","High profile large scale public events are attractive targets for terrorist attacks. The recent Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013 have further emphasized the importance of protecting public events. The security challenge is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of such events: e.g., the impact of an attack at different locations changes over time as the Boston marathon participants and spectators move along the race track. In addition, the defender can relocate security resources among potential attack targets at any time and the attacker may act at any time during the event. This paper focuses on developing efficient patrolling algorithms for such dynamic domains with continuous strategy spaces for both the defender and the attacker. We aim at computing optimal pure defender strategies, since an attacker does not have an opportunity to learn and respond to mixed strategies due to the relative infrequency of such events. We propose SCOUT-A, which makes assumptions on relocation cost, exploits payoff representation and computes optimal solutions efficiently. We also propose SCOUT-C to compute the exact optimal defender strategy for general cases despite the continuous strategy spaces. SCOUT-C computes the optimal defender strategy by constructing an equivalent game with discrete defender strategy space, then solving the constructed game. Experimental results show that both SCOUT-A and SCOUT-C significantly outperform other existing strategies.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8182/8507,"Game theory, Security, Optimization"
115,2014,Main Track: Heuristic Search and Optimization,Relaxation Search: A Simple Way of Managing Optional Clauses,"Fahiem Bacchus, Jessica Davies, Maria Tsimpoukelli, George Katsirelos","A number of problems involve managing a set of optional clauses. For example, the soft clauses in a MAXSAT formula are optional—they can be falsified for a cost. Similarly, when computing a Minimum Correction Set for an unsatisfiable formula, all clauses are optional—some can be falsified in order to satisfy the remaining. In both of these cases the task is to find a subset of the optional clauses that achieves some criteria, and whose removal leaves a satisfiable formula. Relaxation search is a simple method of using a standard SAT solver to solve this task. Relaxation search is easy to implement, sometimes requiring only a simple modification of the variable selection heuristic in the SAT solver; it offers considerable flexibility and control over the order in which subsets of optional clauses are examined; and it automatically exploits clause learning to exchange information between the two phases of finding a suitable subset of optional clauses and checking if their removal yields satisfiability. We demonstrate how relaxation search can be used to solve MAXSAT and to compute Minimum Correction Sets. In both cases relaxation search is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance and solve some instances other solvers are not able to solve.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8618/8508,sat; maxsat; optimization; minimal correction sets

Given a graph with some specified sink nodes and an initial probability distribution,we consider the problem of designing an absorbing Markov Chain that minimizes the time required to reach a sink node, by selecting transition probabilities subject to some natural regularity constraints. By exploiting the Markovian structure, we obtain closed form expressions for the objective function as well as its gradient, which can be thus evaluated efficiently without any simulation of the underlying process and fed to a gradient-based optimization package. For the special case of designing reversible Markov Chains, we show that global optimum can be efficiently computed by exploiting convexity.

Bounded suboptimal search algorithms trade increased solution cost for reduced solving time. Explicit Estimation Search (EES) is a recent state-of-the-art algorithm specifically designed for bounded suboptimal search. Although it tends to expand fewer nodes than alternative algorithms, such as weighted A* (WA*), its per-node expansion overhead is higher, causing it to sometimes take longer. In this paper, we present simplified variants of EES (SEES) and an earlier algorithm, A*epsilon (SA*epsilon), that use different implementations of the same motivating ideas to significantly reduce search overhead and implementation complexity. In an empirical evaluation, we find that SEES, like EES, outperforms classic bounded suboptimal search algorithms, such as WA*, on domains tested where distance-to-go estimates enable better search guidance. We also confirm that, while SEES and SA*epsilon expand roughly the same number of nodes as their progenitors, they solve problems significantly faster and are much easier to implement. This work widens the applicability of state-of the-art bounded suboptimal search by making it easier to deploy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8591/8511,

Many of these methods choose an order to eliminate (or branch on) the parameterized random variables. Similar to such methods for non-relational probabilistic inference, the order of elimination has a significant role in the performance of the algorithms. Since finding the best order is NP-complete even for non-relational models, heuristics have been proposed to find good orderings in the non-relational models. In this paper, we show that these heuristics are inefficient for relational models, because they fail to consider the population sizes associated with logical variables. We extend existing heuristics for non-relational models and propose new heuristics for relational models.

During a preprocessing phase, it computes a Simple Subgoal Graph from a given grid, which is analogous to a visibility graph for continuous terrain, and then partitions the vertices into global and local subgoals to obtain a Two-Level Subgoal Graph. During the path-planning phase, it performs an A* search that ignores local subgoals that are not relevant to the search, which significantly reduces the size of the graph being searched. In this paper, we generalize this partitioning process to any undirected graph and show that it can be recursively applied to generate more than two levels, which reduces the size of the graph being searched even further. We distinguish between basic partitioning, which only partitions the vertices into different levels, and advanced partitioning, which can also add new edges.We show that the construction of Simple-Subgoal Graphs from grids and the construction of Two-Level Subgoal Graphs from Simple Subgoal Graphs are instances of generalized partitioning. We then report on experiments on Subgoal Graphs that demonstrate the effects of different types and levels of partitioning. We also report on experiments that demonstrate that our new N-Level Subgoal Graphs achieve a speed up of 1.6 compared to Two-Level Subgoal graphs from (Uras, Koenig, and Hern´andez 2013) on maps from the video games StarCraft and Dragon Age: Origins.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8497/8514,Heuristic Search; Hierarchical Search; Subgoal Graph

Sturtevant, Jonathan Schaeffer","The use of inconsistent heuristics with A* can result in increased runtime due to the need to re-expand nodes. Poor performance can also be seen with Weighted A* if nodes are re-expanded. While the negative impact of re-expansions can often be minimized by setting these algorithms to never expand nodes more than once, the result can be a lower solution quality. In this paper, we formally show that the loss in solution quality can be bounded based on the amount of inconsistency along optimal solution paths. This bound holds regardless of whether the heuristic is admissible or inadmissible, though if the heuristic is admissible the bound can be used to show that not re-expanding nodes can have at most a quadratic impact on the quality of solutions found when using A*. We then show that the bound is tight by describing a process for the construction of graphs for which a best-first search that does not re-expand nodes will find solutions whose quality is arbitrarily close to that given by the bound. Finally, we will use the bound to extend a known result regarding the solution quality of WA* when weighting a consistent heuristic, so that it also applies to other types of heuristic weighting.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8637/8515,Heuristic search; inconsistent heuristic; node re-expansions; best-first search; inadmissible heuristic; not re-expanding

Although many SCO algorithms have been developed for sparse learning with an optimal convergence rate $O(1/T)$, they often fail to deliver sparse solutions at the end either because of the limited sparsity regularization during stochastic optimization or due to the limitation in online-to-batch conversion. To improve the sparsity of solutions obtained by SCO, we propose a simple but effective stochastic optimization scheme that adds a novel sparse online-to-batch conversion to the traditional SCO algorithms. The theoretical analysis shows that our scheme can find a solution with better sparse patterns without affecting the convergence rate. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that the proposed methods are more effective in recovering the sparse solution and have comparable convergence rate as the state-of-the-art SCO algorithms for sparse learning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8389/8516,Stochastic Optimization; Online Learning; Composite Gradient Mapping; Stochastic Gradient Descent

In this paper we show that PDA development has an important side effect that has not been addressed to date -- the process that merely attempts to capture one's strategy is also likely to affect the developer's strategy. The phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally, using several performance measures. This result has many implications concerning the appropriate design of PDA-based simulations, and the validity of using PDAs for studying individual decision making.

Furthermore, the plethora of CSAs in today's markets enables buyers to query more than a single CSA when shopping, thus expanding even further the list of sellers whose prices they obtain. This potentially decreases the chance of a purchase based on the prices outputted as a result of any single query, and consequently decreases each CSAs' expected revenue per-query. Obviously, a CSA can improve its competence in such settings by acquiring more sellers' prices, potentially resulting in a more attractive ``best price''. In this paper we suggest a complementary approach that improves the attractiveness of a CSA by presenting the prices to the user in a specific intelligent manner, which is based on known cognitive-biases.The advantage of this approach is its ability to affect the buyer's tendency to terminate her search for a better price, hence avoid querying further CSAs, without having the CSA spend any of its resources on finding better prices to present.The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using real data, collected from four CSAs for five products.

The primary novelty of these algorithms is that instead of treating the feedback as a numeric reward signal, they interpret feedback as a form of discrete communication that depends on both the behavior the trainer is trying to teach and the teaching strategy used by the trainer. For example, some human trainers use a lack of feedback to indicate whether actions are correct or incorrect, and interpreting this lack of feedback accurately can significantly improve learning speed. Results from user studies show that humans use a variety of training strategies in practice and both algorithms can learn a contextual bandit task faster than algorithms that treat the feedback as numeric.

For this purpose, Claßen and Lakemeyer recently introduced algorithms for the verification of temporal properties of GOLOG programs. However, given the expressiveness of GOLOG, their verification procedures are not guaranteed to terminate. In this paper, we show how decidability can be obtained by suitably restricting the underlying base logic, the effect axioms for primitive actions, and the use of actions within GOLOG programs.

This intuition has been put forward and (wrongly) assumed to hold in general in the literature. We define a necessary and sufficient condition to characterize whether an LTLf formula is insensitive to infiniteness, which can be automatically checked by any LTL reasoner. Then, we show that typical LTLf specification patterns used in process and service modeling in CS, as well as trajectory constraints in Planning and transition-based LTLf specifications of action domains in KR, are indeed very often insensitive to infiniteness. This may help to explain why the assumption of interpreting LTL on finite and on infinite traces has been (wrongly) blurred. Possibly because of this blurring, virtually all literature detours to Buechi automata for constructing the NFA that accepts the traces satisfying an LTLf formula. As a further contribution, we give a simple direct algorithm for computing such NFA.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8575/8534,Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces; LTL patterns; finite-state automata
142,2014,Main Track: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,A Tractable Approach to ABox Abduction over Description Logic Ontologies,"Jianfeng Du, Kewen Wang, Yi-Dong Shen","ABox abduction is an important reasoning mechanism for description logic ontologies. It computes all minimal explanations (sets of ABox assertions) whose appending to a consistent ontology enforces the entailment of an observation while keeps the ontology consistent. We focus on practical computation for a general problem of ABox abduction, called the query abduction problem, where an observation is a Boolean conjunctive query and the explanations may contain fresh individuals neither in the ontology nor in the observation. However, in this problem there can be infinitely many minimal explanations. Hence we first identify a class of TBoxes called first-order rewritable TBoxes. It guarantees the existence of finitely many minimal explanations and is sufficient for many ontology applications. To reduce the number of explanations that need to be computed, we introduce a special kind of minimal explanations called representative explanations from which all minimal explanations can be retrieved. We develop a tractable method (in data complexity) for computing all representative explanations in a consistent ontology. xperimental results demonstrate that the method is efficient and scalable for ontologies with large ABoxes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8191/8535,ABox abduction; abductive reasoning; query abduction problem; description logics; first-order rewritable

However, their evaluation can be expensive due to external source accesses. In this paper we consider HEX-programs that provide external atoms as a bidirectional interface to external sources and present a novel evaluation method based on support sets, which informally are portions of the input to an external atom that will determine its output for any completion of the partial input. Support sets allow one to shortcut the external source access, which can be completely eliminated. This is particularly attractive if a compact representation of suitable support sets is efficiently constructible.

This paper proposes an alternative definition of elementary loops and identify a subclass of elementary loops, called proper loops. By applying a special form of their loop formulas, proper loops are also sufficient for the SAT-based answer set computation. A polynomial algorithm to recognize a proper loop is given and shows that for certain logic programs, identifying all proper loops of a program is more efficient than that of elementary loops. Furthermore, we prove that, by considering the structure of the positive body-head dependency graph of a program, a large number of loops could be ignored for identifying proper loops.

One instantiation, among many others, of Dung's framework consists in constructing the arguments from a set of propositional logic formulas. Thus an argument is seen as a reason for or against the truth of a particular statement. Despite its advantages, the argumentation approach for inconsistency handling also has important shortcomings. More precisely, in some applications what one is interested in are not so much only the conclusions supported by the arguments but also the precise explications of such conclusions. We show that argumentation framework applied to classical logic formulas is not suitable to deal with this problem. On the other hand, intuitionistic logic appears to be a natural alternative candidate logic (instead of classical logic) to instantiate Dung's framework.

TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling.

Our research addresses this situation through the development of novel electrocardiographic(ECG) markers to identify patients at risk of PAF. As a first step, we explore an eigen-decomposition approach that partitions ECG signals into atrial and ventricular components by exploiting knowledge of the underlying cardiac cycle. We then quantify electrical instability in the myocardium manifesting as probabilistic variations in atrial ECG morphology to assess therisk of PAF.

Transfer learning tends to be exploited as a powerful tool that mitigates the discrepancy between different databases used for knowledge transfer. It can also be used for knowledge transfer between different modalities within one database. However, in either case, transfer learning will fail if the target data are missing. To overcome this, we consider knowledge transfer between different databases and modalities simultaneously in a single framework, where missing target data from one database are recovered to facilitate recognition task. We referred to this framework as Latent Low-rank Transfer Subspace Learning method (L2TSL). We first propose to use a low-rank constraint as well as dictionary learning in a learned subspace to guide the knowledge transfer between and within different databases. We then introduce a latent factor to uncover the underlying structure of the missing target data. Next, transfer learning in two directions is proposed to integrate auxiliary database for transfer learning with missing target data.

169,2014,Main Track: Machine Learning Applications,Low-Rank Tensor Learning with Discriminant Analysis for Action Classification and Image Recovery,"Chengcheng Jia, Guoqiang Zhong, Yun Fu","Tensor completion is an important topic in the area of image processing and computer vision research, which is generally built on extraction of the intrinsic structure of the tensor data. Drawing on this fact, action classification, relying heavily on the extracted features of high-dimensional tensors, may indeed benefit from tensor completion techniques. In this paper, we propose a low-rank tensor completion method for action classification, as well as image recovery. Since there may exist distortion and corruption in the tensor representations of video sequences, we project the tensors into a subspace, which contains the invariant structure of the tensors. In order to integrate useful supervisory information for classification, we adopt a discriminant analysis criterion to learn the projection matrices. The resulting multi-variate optimization problem can be effectively solved using the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method results with better accuracy compared with some other state-of-the-art low-rank tensor representation learning approaches on the MSR Hand Gesture 3D database and the MSR Action 3D database. By denoising the Multi-PIE face database, our experimental setup testifies the proposed method can also be employed to recover images.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8222/8908,

Due to the content sparsity and lackof labeled data, it is better to employ semi-supervisedlearning methods to utilize the unlabeled data. However,most of previous semi-supervised learning methods donot consider the pair conflict problem, which means thatthe new selected unlabeled data may conflict with the labeled and previously selected data. It will hurt the learning performance a lot, if the training data contains manyconflict pairs. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative semi-supervised SVM ranking model (CSR-TC)with consideration of the order conflict. The unlabeleddata is selected based on a dynamically maintained transitive closure graph to avoid pair conflict. We also investigate the two views of features, intrinsic and contentrelevant features, for the proposed model. Extensive experiments are conducted on TREC Microblogging corpus.

Our system explores an open-ended space of statistical models to discover a good explanation of a data set, and then produces a detailed report with figures and natural-language text. Our approach treats unknown regression functions nonparametrically using Gaussian processes, which has two important consequences. First, Gaussian processes can model functions in terms of high-level properties (e.g. smoothness, trends, periodicity, changepoints). Taken together with the compositional structure of our language of models this allows us to automatically describe functions in simple terms. Second, the use of flexible nonparametric models and a rich language for composing them in an open-ended manner also results in state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluated over 13 real time series data sets from various domains.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8240/8564,Automatic statistician; Gaussian process; Time series; Natural language; Nonparametric; Regression

Comparing with previous iterative solvers for nonconvex sparse problem, PIRE is much more general and efficient. The computational cost of PIRE in each iteration is usually as low as the state-of-the-art convex solvers. We further propose the PIRE algorithm with Parallel Splitting (PIRE-PS) and PIRE algorithm with Alternative Updating (PIRE-AU) to handle the multi-variable problems.

In the literature, to improve the traditional visual bag-of-words (BOW) representation, latent semantic analysis has been studied extensively for learning a compact visual representation, where each visual word may be related to multiple latent topics. However, these latent topics do not convey any true semantic information which can be understood by human. In fact, it remains a challenging problem how to recover the relationships between visual and textual words. Motivated by the recent advances in dealing with socially tagged images, we develop a direct semantic analysis method which can explicitly learn the correlation matrix between visual and textual words for social image classification. To this end, we formulate our direct semantic analysis from a graph-based learning viewpoint. Once the correlation matrix is learnt, we can readily first obtain a semantically refined visual BOW representation and then apply it to social image classification. Experimental results on two benchmark image datasets show the promising performance of the proposed method.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8189/8566,

Brodley","Selecting good conference keywords is important because they often determine the composition of review committees and hence which papers are reviewed by whom. But presently conference keywords are generated in an ad-hoc manner by a small set of conference organizers. This approach is plainly not ideal. There is no guarantee, for example, that the generated keyword set aligns with what the community is actually working on and submitting to the conference in a given year. This is especially true in fast moving fields such as AI. The problem is exacerbated by the tendency of organizers to draw heavily on preceding years' keyword lists when generating a new set. Rather than a select few ordaining a keyword set that that represents AI at large, it would be preferable to generate these keywords more directly from the data, with input from research community members. To this end, we solicited feedback from seven AAAI PC members regarding a previously existing keyword set and used these 'community-sourced constraints' to inform a clustering over the abstracts of all submissions to AAAI 2013. We show that the keywords discovered via this data-driven, human-in-the-loop method are at least as preferred (by AAAI PC members) as 2013's manually generated set, and that they include categories previously overlooked by organizers.

Understanding factors affecting student engagement will help in designing better courses and improving student retention.  The large number of participants in massive open online courses (MOOCs) and data collected from their interaction with the MOOC open up avenues for studying student engagement at scale. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling and understanding student engagement in online courses based on student behavioral cues. Our first contribution is the abstraction of student engagement types using latent representations and using that in a probabilistic model to connect student behavior with course completion. We demonstrate that the latent formulation for engagement helps in predicting student survival across three MOOCs. Next, in order to initiate better instructor interventions, we need to be able to predict student survival early in the course. We demonstrate that we can predict student survival early in the course reliably using the latent model. Finally, we perform a closer quantitative analysis of user interaction with the MOOC and identify student activities that are good indicators for survival at different points in the course.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8571/8568,"MOOCs, student engagement, predictive modeling, statistical relational learning, student survival"

Traditional tensor decomposition approaches face three major challenges: model selecting, gross corruptions and computational efficiency. To address these problems, we first propose a parallel trace norm regularized tensor decomposition method, and formulate it as a convex optimization problem. This mehtod does not require the rank of each mode to be specified beforehand, and can automaticaly determine the number of factors in each mode through our optimization scheme. By considering the low-rank structure of the observed tensor, we analyze the equivalent relationship of the trace norm between a low-rank tensor and its core tensor. Then, we cast a non-convex tensor decomposition model into a weighted combination of multiple much smaller-scale matrix trace norm minimization. Finally, we develop two parallel alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) to solve our problems. Experimental results verify that our regularized formulation is effective, and our methods are robust to noise or outliers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8493/8569,

In particular, as the core engine of many financial services such as private wealth and pension fund management, portfolio management calls for the application of those novel algorithms. Most of portfolio allocation strategies do not account for costs from market frictions such as transaction costs and capital gain taxes, as the complexity of sensible cost models often causes the induced problem intractable. In this paper, we propose a doubly regularized portfolio that provides a modest but effective solution to the above difficulty. Specifically, as all kinds of trading costs primarily root in large transaction volumes, to reduce volumes we synergistically combine two penalty terms with classic risk minimization models to ensure: (1) only a small set of assets are selected to invest in each period; (2) portfolios in consecutive trading periods are similar. To assess the new portfolio, we apply standard evaluation criteria and conduct extensive experiments on well-known benchmarks and market datasets. Compared with various state-of-the-art portfolios, the proposed portfolio demonstrates a superior performance of having both higher risk-adjusted returns and dramatically decreased transaction volumes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8286/8570,"Portfolio Optimization, Risk Minimization, Structure Regularization"

In this work, we explore the possibility of employing deep learning in graph clustering.  We propose a simple method, which first learns a nonlinear embedding of the original graph by stacked autoencoder, and then runs  $k$-means algorithm on the embedding to obtain the clustering result. We show that this simple method has solid theoretical foundation, due to the similarity between autoencoder and spectral clustering in terms of what they actually optimize. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and flexible than spectral clustering. First, the computational complexity of autoencoder is much lower than spectral clustering: the former can be linear to the number of nodes in a sparse graph while the latter is super quadratic due to eigenvalue decomposition. Second, when additional sparsity constraint is imposed, we can simply employ the sparse autoencoder developed in the literature of deep learning; however, it is non-straightforward to implement a sparse spectral method. The experimental results on various graph datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional spectral clustering which clearly indicates the effectiveness of deep learning in graph clustering.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8527/8571,deep representations;clustering on graph;neural networks

Behavior data in these systems are generated by live agents: once systems change due to adoption of prediction models learnt from behavior data, agents will observe and respond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. Therefore, the evolving behavior data will not be identically and independently distributed, posing great challenges to theoretical analysis. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments (MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of machine learning algorithms on its basis. We propose a novel technique that transforms the original time-variant MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov chain, which is easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when time approaches infinity. Then we obtain a generalization bound for the machine learning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain.

This is especially true for trauma patients, where the emergent nature of the cases makes it difficult to collect all of the relevant data for each patient. Standard methods for handling missingness first learn a model to estimate missing data values, and subsequently train and evaluate a classifier using data imputed with this model. Recently, several proposed methods have demonstrated the benefits of jointly estimating the imputation model and classifier parameters. However, these methods make assumptions that limit their utility with many real-world medical datasets. For example, the assumption that data elements are missing at random is often invalid. We address this situation by exploring a novel approach for jointly learning the imputation model and classifier. Unlike previous algorithms, our approach makes no assumptions about the missingness of the data, can be used with arbitrary probabilistic data models and classification loss functions, and can be used when both the training and testing data have missing values. We investigate the utility of this approach on the prediction of several patient outcomes in a large national registry of trauma patients, and find that it significantly outperforms standard sequential methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8403/8573,missing values; trauma

We find significant correlations between the induced groupings and patient survey response data comprising ratings of physician communication.

In this paper, we present a robust distance learning method in the presence of label noise, by extending a previous non-parametric discriminative distance learning algorithm, i.e., Neighbourhood Components Analysis (NCA). Particularly, we analyze the effect of label noise on the derivative of likelihood with respect to the transformation matrix, and propose to model the conditional probability of the true label of each point so as to reduce that effect. The model is then optimized within the EM framework, with additional regularization used to avoid overfitting.

In our new method, we introduce a new measurement using the neighborhood data variances to assess the data locality, by which we propose to learn an optimal projection by rewarding both the global and local structures of the input data. The formulated optimization problem is challenging to solve, because it ends up a trace ratio minimization problem.

However, most existing MIL methods do not consider the problem of insufficient examples in the given target category. In this case, it is difficult for traditional MIL methods to build an accurate classifier due to the lack of training examples. Motivated by the empirical success of transfer learning, this paper proposes a novel approach of Adaptive Knowledge Transfer for Multiple Instance Learning (AKT-MIL) in image classification. The new method transfers cross-category knowledge from source categories under multiple instance setting for boosting the learning process. A unified learning framework with a data-dependent mixture model is designed to adaptively combine the transferred knowledge from sources with a weak classifier built in the target domain. Based on this framework, an iterative coordinate descent method with Constraint Concave-Convex Programming (CCCP) is proposed as the optimization procedure.

In this paper, we propose a novel matrix completion based framework that aims to tackle two challenging issues simultaneously: i) handling missing and noisy sensitive data, and ii) preserving the privacy of the sensitive data during the learning process. In particular, the proposed framework is able to mask the sensitive data while ensuring that the transformed data are still usable for training regression models. We show that two key properties, namely model preserving and privacy preserving, are satisfied by the transformed data obtained from the proposed framework. In model preserving, we guarantee that the linear regression model built from the masked data approximates the regression model learned from the original data in a perfect way. In privacy preserving, we ensure that the original sensitive data cannot be recovered since the transformation procedure is irreversible. Given these two characteristics, the transformed data can be safely released to any learners for designing prediction models without revealing any private content.

Most of the existing approaches either rely on a model trained by a preselected and manually labeled set of activities, or perform micro-pattern analysis with manually selected length and number of micro-patterns. Since real life ADL datasets are massive, such approaches would be too costly to apply. Thus, there is a need to formulate unsupervised methods that can be applied to different time scales.We propose a novel approach to discover clusters of daily activity routines.We use a matrix decomposition method to isolate routines and deviations to obtain two different sets of clusters. We obtain the final memberships via the cross product of these sets. We validate our approach using two real-life ADL datasets and a well-known artificial dataset.

We show for the first time that the proximal operator to this objective function is readily computable through a hybrid singular value thresholding scheme. This leads to a new solution to high-order (low-rank) tensor completion via convex relaxation.

Most of existing studies took advantage of machine learning approaches to predict ad click for each event of ad view independently. However, as observed in the real-world sponsored search system, user's behaviors on ads yield high dependency on how the user behaved along with the past time, especially in terms of what queries she submitted, what ads she clicked or ignored, and how long she spent on the landing pages of clicked ads, etc. Inspired by these observations, we introduce a novel framework based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Compared to traditional methods, this framework directly models the dependency on user's sequential behaviors into the click prediction process through the recurrent structure in RNN.

This puts a premium on quickly allocating tasks to agents, but finding the optimal allocation is NP-hard due to temporal and spatial constraints that require tasks to be executed sequentially by agents. We propose FMC_TA, a novel task allocation algorithm that allows tasks to be easily sequenced to yield high-quality solutions. FMC_TA first finds allocations that are fair (envy-free), balancing the load and sharing important tasks between agents, and efficient (Pareto optimal) in a simplified version of the problem.  It computes such allocations in polynomial or pseudo-polynomial time (centrally or distributedly, respectively) using a Fisher market with agents as buyers and tasks as goods. It then heuristically schedules the allocations, taking into account inter-agent constraints on shared tasks.

We outline a model for analyzing such problems, defining robust winners relative to potential candidate unavailability. We assess the complexity of computing robust winners for several voting rules.

The goal is to ensure that p wins by shifting p higher in some voters' preference orders.  However, each such shift request comes at a price (depending on the voter and on the extent of the shift) and we must not exceed the given budget. We study the parameterized computational complexity of Shift Bribery with respect to a number of parameters (pertaining to the nature of the solution sought and the size of the election) and several classes of price functions. When we parameterize Shift Bribery by the number of affected voters, then for each of our voting rules (Borda, Maximin, Copeland) the problem is W[2]-hard. If, instead, we parameterize by the number of positions by which p is shifted in total, then the problem is fixed-parameter tractable for Borda and Maximin, and is W[1]-hard for Copeland. If we parameterize by the budget for the cost of shifting,  then the results depend on the price function class.

Under additive valuations, we show that even when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a linear fraction, envy-free allocations are unlikely to exist.  We then show that when the number of goods is larger by a logarithmic factor, such allocations exist with high probability.

While fielded kidney exchanges see huge benefit from altruistic kidney donors (who give an organ without a paired needy candidate), a significantly higher medical risk to the donor deters similar altruism with livers.  In this paper, we begin by proposing the idea of liver exchange, and show on demographically accurate data that vetted kidney exchange algorithms can be adapted to clear such an exchange at the nationwide level.  We then explore cross-organ donation where kidneys and livers can be bartered for each other.  We show theoretically that this multi-organ exchange provides linearly more transplants than running separate kidney and liver exchanges; this linear gain is a product of altruistic kidney donors creating chains that thread through the liver pool.  We support this result experimentally on demographically accurate multi-organ exchanges.  We conclude with thoughts regarding the fielding of a nationwide liver or joint liver-kidney exchange from a legal and computational point of view.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8349/8588,Kidney exchange; Liver exchange; Multi-organ exchange; Cycle cover

The basic idea is to use more than one composition functions and adaptively select them depending on the input vectors. We present a general framework to model each semantic composition as a distribution over these composition functions. The composition functions and parameters used for adaptive selection are learned jointly from data.

To address this problem, motivated by collaborative behaviors in human referential communication, we have developed two collaborative models - an episodic model and an installment model - for referring expression generation. Both models, instead of generating a single referring expression to describe a target object as in the previous work, generate multiple small expressions that lead to the target object with the goal of minimizing the collaborative effort. In particular, our installment model incorporates human feedback in a reinforcement learning framework to learn the optimal generation strategies.

To create such an interface in real time, we need reliable prediction algorithms to classify and predict new reviews which have not been voted but are potentially helpful. So far such helpfulness prediction algorithms have benefited from structural aspects, such as the length and readability score. Since emotional words are at the heart of our written communication and are powerful to trigger listeners' attention, we believe that emotional words can serve as important parameters for predicting helpfulness of review text. Using GALC, a general lexicon of emotional words associated with a model representing 20 different categories, we extracted the emotionality from the review text and applied supervised classification method to derive the emotion-based helpful review prediction.

Training distributed representations of words with neural networks has lately been a major focus of researchers in the field. Recent work on word embedding, the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Continuous Skip-gram (Skip-gram) model, have produced particularly impressive results, significantly speeding up the training process to enable word representation learning from large-scale data. However, both CBOW and Skip-gram do not pay enough attention to word proximity in terms of model or word ambiguity in terms of linguistics. In this paper, we propose Proximity-Ambiguity Sensitive (PAS) models (i.e. PAS CBOW and PAS Skip-gram) to produce high quality distributed representations of words considering both word proximity and ambiguity. From the model perspective, we introduce proximity weights as parameters to be learned in PAS CBOW and used in PAS Skip-gram. By better modeling word proximity, we reveal the strength of pooling-structured neural networks in word representation learning. The proximity-sensitive pooling layer can also be applied to other neural network applications that employ pooling layers.

However, most of existing topic methods only model the sentiment text, but do not consider the user, who expresses the sentiment, and the item, which the sentiment is expressed on. Since different users may use different sentiment expressions for different items, we argue that it is better to incorporate the user and item information into the topic model for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a new Supervised User-Item based Topic model, called SUIT model, for sentiment analysis. It can simultaneously utilize the textual topic and latent user-item factors. Our proposed method uses the tensor outer product of text topic proportion vector, user latent factor and item latent factor to model the sentiment label generalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets: review dataset and microblog dataset. The results demonstrate the advantages of our model. It shows significant improvement compared with supervised topic models and collaborative filtering methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8663/8620,

Huang, Xin Gao","A combination of the sparse coding and transfer learning techniques was shown to be accurate and robust in classification tasks where training and testing objects have a shared feature space but are sampled from different underlying distributions, i.e., belong to different domains. The key assumption in such case is that in spite of the domain disparity, samples from different domains share some common hidden factors. Previous methods often assumed that all the objects in the target domain are unlabeled, and thus the training set solely comprised objects from the source domain. However, in real world applications, the target domain often has some labeled objects, or one can always manually label a small number of them. In this paper, we explore such possibility and show how a small number of labeled data in the target domain can significantly leverage classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art transfer sparse coding methods. We further propose a unified framework named supervised transfer sparse coding (STSC) which simultaneously optimizes sparse representation, domain transfer and classification.

The algorithm actively samples points for training that are most likely to improve the accuracy of the more promising candidate models, and also samples points for model selection---all samples count against the same labeling budget. This exposes a natural trade-off between the focused active sampling that is most effective for training models, and the unbiased sampling that is better for model selection.

In contrast to typical multi-objective problems, they do not require the identification of trade-offs between the objectives, as (near-) optimal solutions for any objective are (near-) optimal for every objective. Intelligently combining the feedback from these objectives, instead of only looking at a single one, can improve optimization. This class of problems is very relevant in reinforcement learning, as any single-objective reinforcement learning problem can be framed as such a multi-objective problem using multiple reward shaping functions. After discussing this problem class, we propose a solution technique for such reinforcement learning problems, called adaptive objective selection. This technique  makes a temporal difference learner estimate the Q-function for each objective in parallel, and introduces a way of measuring confidence in these estimates. This confidence metric is then used to choose which objective's estimates to use for action selection. We show significant improvements in performance over other plausible techniques on two problem domains.

Conditional RBMs (CRBMs) are an extension of RBMs tailored to modeling temporal data. A drawback of CRBMs is their consideration of linear temporal dependencies, which limits their capability to capture complex temporal structure. They also require many variables to model long temporal dependencies, a fact that might provoke overfitting proneness. To resolve these issues, in this paper we propose the echo-state CRBM (ES-CRBM): our model uses an echo-state network reservoir in the context of CRBMs to efficiently capture long and complex temporal dynamics, with much fewer trainable parameters compared to conventional CRBMs. In addition, we introduce an (implicit) mixture of ES-CRBM experts (im-ES-CRBM) to enhance even further the capabilities of our ES-CRBM model. The introduced im-ES-CRBM allows for better modeling temporal observations which might comprise a number of latent or observable subpatterns that alternate in a dynamic fashion. It also allows for performing sequence segmentation using our framework. We apply our methods to sequential data modeling and classification experiments using public datasets.

In this paper, we formulate a kernelized Bayesian transfer learning framework that is a principled combination of kernel-based dimensionality reduction models with task-specific projection matrices to find a shared subspace and a coupled classification model for all of the tasks in this subspace. Our two main contributions are: (i) two novel probabilistic models for binary and multiclass classification, and (ii) very efficient variational approximation procedures for these models. We illustrate the generalization performance of our algorithms on two different applications. In computer vision experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on nine out of 12 benchmark supervised domain adaptation experiments defined on two object recognition data sets. In cancer biology experiments, we use our algorithm to predict mutation status of important cancer genes from gene expression profiles using two distinct cancer populations, namely, patient-derived primary tumor data and in-vitro-derived cancer cell line data. We show that we can increase our generalization performance on primary tumors using cell lines as an auxiliary data source.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8132/8817,transfer learning; domain adaptation; cross-domain learning; kernel methods; variational approximation

By assuming that the high-dimensional data usually lie on a low-dimensional manifold, many algorithms have been proposed. However, most algorithms simply adopt the traditional graph Laplacian to encode the data locality, so the discriminative ability is limited and the embedding results are not always suitable for the subsequent classification. Instead, this paper deploys the signed graph Laplacian and proposes Signed Laplacian Embedding (SLE) for supervised dimension reduction. By exploring the label information, SLE comprehensively transfers the discrimination carried by the original data to the embedded low-dimensional space. Without perturbing the discrimination structure, SLE also retains the locality.Theoretically, we prove the immersion property by computing the rank of projection, and relate SLE to existing algorithms in the frame of patch alignment. Thorough empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SLE.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8165/8819,Dimension reduction; Manifold learning; Signed graph Laplacian

A key assumption in most MTL algorithms is that all tasks are related, which, however, may not hold in many real-world applications. Existing techniques, which attempt to address this issue, aim to identify groups of related tasks using group sparsity. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic tree sparsity (PTS) model to utilize the tree structure to obtain the sparse solution instead of the group structure. Specifically, each model coefficient in the learning model is decomposed into a product of multiple component coefficients each of which corresponds to a node in the tree. Based on the decomposition, Gaussian and Cauchy distributions are placed on the component coefficients as priors to restrict the model complexity. We devise an efficient expectation maximization algorithm to learn the model parameters.

Due to the social nature of human beings, group activities have become an integral part of our daily life, thus motivating the study on group RS (GRS). However, most existing methods used by GRS make recommendations through aggregating individual ratings or individual predictive results rather than considering the collective features that govern user choices made within a group. As a result, such methods are heavily sensitive to data, hence they often fail to learn group preferences when the data are slightly inconsistent with predefined aggregation assumptions. To this end, we devise a novel GRS approach which accommodates both individual choices and group decisions in a joint model. More specifically, we propose a deep-architecture model built with collective deep belief networks and dual-wing restricted Boltzmann machines. With such a deep model, we can use high-level features, which are induced from lower-level features, to represent group preference so as to relieve the vulnerability of data. Finally, the experiments conducted on a real-world dataset prove the superiority of our deep model over other state-of-the-art methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8458/8821,group recommender system; feature learning; deep learning; restricted boltzmann machine; deep belief net

Existing MIML approaches have been found useful in many applications; however, most of them can only handle moderate-sized data. To efficiently handle large data sets, we propose the MIMLfast approach, which first constructs a low-dimensional subspace shared by all labels, and then trains label specific linear models to optimize approximated ranking loss via stochastic gradient descent. Although the MIML problem is complicated, MIMLfast is able to achieve excellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and discovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the performance of MIMLfast is highly competitive to state-of-the-art techniques, whereas its time cost is much less; particularly, on a data set with 30K bags and 270K instances, where none of existing approaches can return results in 24 hours, MIMLfast takes only 12 minutes.

Controlling the growth of the case base is a fundamental problem, and research on case-base maintenance has developed methods for compacting case bases while maintaining system competence, primarily by competence-based deletion strategies assuming static case adaptation knowledge.  This paper proposes adaptation-guided case-base maintenance (AGCBM), a case-base maintenance approach exploiting the ability to dynamically generate new adaptation knowledge from cases.  In AGCBM, case retention decisions are based both on cases' value as base cases for solving problems and on their value for generating new adaptation rules. he paper illustrates the method for numerical prediction tasks (case-based regression) in which adaptation rules are generated automatically using the case difference heuristic.

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has become an important technique in multi-view learning, since it can fully utilize the inter-view correlation. In this paper, we mainly study the CCA based multi-view supervised feature learning technique where the labels of training samples are known. Several supervised CCA based multi-view methods have been presented, which focus on investigating the supervised correlation across different views. However, they take no account of the intra-view correlation between samples. Researchers have also introduced the discriminant analysis technique into multi-view feature learning, such as multi-view discriminant analysis (MvDA). But they ignore the canonical correlation within each view and between all views. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view feature learning approach based on intra-view and inter-view supervised correlation analysis (I2SCA), which can explore the useful correlation information of samples within each view and between all views. The objective function of I2SCA is designed to simultaneously extract the discriminatingly correlated features from both inter-view and intra-view. It can obtain an analytical solution without iterative calculation. And we provide a kernelized extension of I2SCA to tackle the linearly inseparable problem in the original feature space.

While the approach has lead to many successes, IL often requires a large set of demonstrations to achieve robust learning, which can be expensive for the teacher. In this paper, we consider a novel approach to improve the learning efficiency of IL by providing a shaping reward function in addition to the usual demonstrations. Shaping rewards are numeric functions of states (and possibly actions) that are generally easily specified, and capture general principles of desired behavior, without necessarily completely specifying the behavior. Shaping rewards have been used extensively in reinforcement learning, but have been seldom considered for IL, though they are often easy to specify. Our main contribution is to propose an IL approach that learns from both shaping rewards and demonstrations.

In this setting, each choice is a node of a graph and the expected payoffs of the neighboring nodes are assumed to be similar. Although the setting has application both in recommender systems and advertising, the traditional algorithms would scale poorly with the number of choices. For that purpose we consider an effective dimension d, which is small in real-world graphs. We deliver the analysis showing that the regret of SpectralTS scales as d\sqrt(T \ln N) with high probability, where T is the time horizon and N is the number of choices. Since a d\sqrt(T \ln N) regret is comparable to the known results, SpectralTS offers a computationally more efficient alternative.

Recently, a promising method was proposed to account for the feature extraction cost at testing time, called Cost-sensitive Tree of Classifiers (CSTC).

This relaxation is slow to train and requires involved optimization hyperparameter tuning.

To this end, it exploits and modifies the Riemannian geometric properties of the target distribution to create \emph{wormholes} connecting modes in order to facilitate moving between them. Further, our proposed method uses the regeneration technique in order to adapt the algorithm by identifying new modes and updating the network of wormholes without affecting the stationary distribution.

Most existing word embedding results are generally trained on one individual data source such as news pages or Wikipedia articles. However, when we apply them to other tasks such as web search, the performance suffers. To obtain a robust word embedding for different applications, multiple data sources could be leveraged. In this paper, we proposed a two-side multimodal neural network to learn a robust word embedding from multiple data sources including free text, user search queries and search click-through data. This framework takes the word embeddings learned from different data sources as pre-train, and then uses a two-side neural network to unify these embeddings. The pre-trained embeddings are obtained by adapting the recently proposed CBOW algorithm. Since the proposed neural network does not need to re-train word embeddings for a new task, it is highly scalable in real world problem solving. Besides, the network allows weighting different sources differently when applied to different application tasks.

Since multi-object relationships are naturally represented as a tensor, tensor factorization is becom- ing more important for predicting users’ possible ac- tivities. However, its prediction accuracy is weak for ambiguous and/or sparsely observed objects. Our so- lution, Semantic data Representation for Tensor Fac- torization (SRTF), tackles these problems by incorpo- rating semantics into tensor factorization based on the following ideas: (1) It first links objects to vocabu- laries/taxonomies and resolves the ambiguity caused by objects that can be used for multiple purposes. (2) It next links objects to composite classes that merge classes in different kinds of vocabularies/taxonomies (e.g. classes in vocabularies for movie genres and those for directors) to avoid low prediction accuracy caused by rough-grained semantics. (3) It then lifts sparsely observed objects into their classes to solve the sparsity problem for rarely observed objects.

It is known an interesting connection between multi-agent learning algorithms and evolutionary game theory, showing that the learning dynamics of some algorithms can be modeled as replicator dynamics with a mutation term. Inspired by the recent sequence-form replicator dynamics, we develop a new version of the Q-learning algorithm working on the sequence form of an extensive-form game allowing thus an exponential reduction of the dynamics length w.r.t. those of the normal form. The dynamics of the proposed algorithm can be modeled by using the sequence-form replicator dynamics with a mutation term. We show that, although sequence-form and normal-form replicator dynamics are realization equivalent, the Q-learning algorithm applied to the two forms have non-realization equivalent dynamics.

Originally, its analysis assumed that the bootstraps are built from an unlimited, independent source of samples, therefore we call this form of bagging ideal-bagging. However in the real world, base predictors are trained on data subsampled from a limited number of training samples and thus they behave very differently. We analyze the effect of intersections between bootstraps, obtained by subsampling, to train different base predictors. Most importantly, we provide an alternative subsampling method called design-bagging based on a new construction of combinatorial designs, and prove it universally better than bagging. Methodologically, we succeed at this level of generality because we compare the prediction accuracy of bagging and design-bagging relative to the accuracy ideal-bagging. This finds potential applications in more involved bagging-based methods.

283,2014,Main Track: Novel Machine Learning Algorithms,Anytime Active Learning,"Maria Eugenia Ramirez-Loaiza, Aron Culotta, Mustafa Bilgic","A common bottleneck in deploying supervised learning systems is collecting human-annotated examples. In many domains, annotators form an opinion about the label of an example incrementally -- e.g., each additional word read from a document or each additional minute spent inspecting a video helps inform the annotation.  In this paper, we investigate whether we can train learning systems more efficiently by requesting an annotation before inspection is fully complete -- e.g., after reading only 25 words of a document. While doing so may reduce the overall annotation time, it also introduces the risk that the annotator might not be able to provide a label if interrupted too early. We propose an anytime active learning approach that optimizes the annotation time and response rate simultaneously.  We conduct user studies on two document classification datasets and develop simulated annotators that mimic the users. Our simulated experiments show that anytime active learning outperforms several baselines on these two datasets. For example, with an annotation budget of one hour, training a classifier by annotating the first 25 words of each document reduces classification error by 17% over annotating the first 100 words of each document.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8548/8848,active learning; non-uniform labeling cost; document classification

To analyze the approach theoretically, we derive a generalization bound that justifies the sparse combination.

Although the stated goal of MI-based feature selection is to identify a subset of features that share the highest mutual information with the class variable, most current MI-based techniques are greedy methods that make use of low dimensional MI quantities. The reason for using low dimensional approximation has been mostly attributed to the difficulty associated with estimating the high dimensional MI from limited samples. In this paper, we argue a different viewpoint that, given a very large amount of data, the high dimensional MI objective is still problematic to be employed as a meaningful optimization criterion, due to its overfitting nature: the MI almost always increases as more features are added, thus leading to a trivial solution which includes all features. We propose a novel approach to the MI-based feature selection problem, in which the overfitting phenomenon is controlled rigourously by means of a statistical test. We develop local and global optimization algorithms for this new feature selection model, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the applications of explaining variables and objects.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8139/8843,feature selection; mutual information

Conventional metric learning algorithms have limited utility when the training data and testing data are drawn from related but different domains (i.e., source domain and target domain). Although this issue has got some progress in feature-based transfer learning, most of the work in this area suffers from non-trivial optimization and pays little attention to preserving the discriminating information. In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning algorithm to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain in an information-theoretic setting, where a shared Mahalanobis distance across two domains is learnt by combining  three goals together: 1) reducing the distribution difference between different domains; 2) preserving the geometry of target domain data; 3) aligning the geometry of source domain data with its label information. Based on this combination, the learnt Mahalanobis distance   effectively transfers the discriminating power and propagates  standard classifiers  across these two domains.

In the current literatures, a large family of algorithms builds the new kernel by using the weighted average of predefined base kernels. While optimal weighting schemes have been studied extensively, the choice of base kernels received much less attention. Many methods simply adopt the empirical kernel matrices or its eigenvectors.  Such base kernels are computed irrespective of class labels and may not always reflect useful structures in the data. As a result, in case of poor base kernels, the generalization performance can be degraded however hard their weights are tuned. In this paper, we propose to construct high-quality base kernels with the help of label information to globally improve the final target alignment. In particular, we devise label-aware kernel eigenvectors under the framework of semi-supervised eigenfunction extrapolation, which span base kernels that are more useful for learning.  Such base kernels are individually better aligned to the learning target, so their mixture will more likely generate a  good classifier.

Accordingly, we devise a scalable and robust subspace clustering method which costs time only linear in $n$.

The exact sampling algorithm of DPP requires the full eigenvalue decomposition of the kernel matrix which has high time and space complexities. This prohibits the applications of DPP from large-scale datasets. Previous work has applied the Nystrom method to speedup the sampling algorithm of DPP, and error bounds have been established for the approximation. In this paper we employ the matrix ridge approximation (MRA) to speedup the sampling algorithm of DPP, showing that our approach MRA-DPP has stronger error bound than the Nystrom-DPP.

Best performance would be obtained by optimizing the classification error jointly over DR mapping and classifier (a wrapper approach), but this is a difficult nonconvex problem, particularly with nonlinear DR. Using the method of auxiliary coordinates, we give a simple, efficient algorithm to train a combination of nonlinear DR and a classifier, and apply it to a RBF mapping with a linear SVM. This alternates steps where we train the RBF mapping and a linear SVM as usual regression and classification, respectively, with a closed-form step that coordinates both. The resulting nonlinear low-dimensional classifier achieves classification errors competitive with the state-of-the-art but is fast at training and testing, and allows the user to trade off runtime for classification accuracy easily. We then study the role of nonlinear DR in linear classification, and the interplay between the DR mapping, the number of latent dimensions and the number of classes. When trained jointly, the DR mapping takes an extreme role in eliminating variation: it tends to collapse classes in latent space, erasing all manifold structure, and lay out class centroids so they are linearly separable with maximum margin.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8255/8811,"nonconvex optimization, classification, wrapper approaches"

Supervised hashing, which incorporates similarity/dissimilarity information on entity pairs to improve the quality of hashing function learning, has recently received increasing attention. However, in the existing supervised hashing methods for images, an input image is usually encoded by a vector of hand-crafted visual features. Such hand-crafted feature vectors do not necessarily preserve the accurate semantic similarities of images pairs, which may often degrade the performance of hashing function learning. In this paper, we propose a supervised hashing method for image retrieval, in which we automatically learn a good image representation tailored to hashing as well as a set of hash functions. The proposed method has two stages. In the first stage, given the pairwise similarity matrix $S$ over training images, we propose a scalable coordinate descent method to decompose $S$ into a product of $HH^T$ where $H$ is a matrix with each of its rows being the approximate hash code associated to a training image. In the second stage, we propose to simultaneously learn a good feature representation for the input images as well as a set of hash functions, via a deep convolutional network tailored to the learned hash codes in $H$ and optionally the discrete class labels of the images.

Most recent work on IRL assumes the same level of trustworthiness of all expert behaviors, and frames IRL as a process of seeking reward function that makes those behaviors appear (near)-optimal. However, it is common in reality that noisy expert behaviors disobeying the optimal policy exist, which may degrade the IRL performance significantly. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a robust IRL framework that can accurately estimate the reward function in the presence of behavior noise. In particular, we focus on a special type of behavior noise referred to as sparse noise due to its wide popularity in real-world behavior data. To model such noise, we introduce a novel latent variable characterizing the reliability of each expert action and use Laplace distribution as its prior. We then devise an EM algorithm with a novel variational inference procedure in the E-step, which can automatically identify and remove behavior noise in reward learning.

However, in many real-world scenarios, this assumption may not hold. As a result, the constructed feature mapping may not be precisely due to the bias issue of the correspondences in the target or (and) source domain(s). In this case, a classifier trained on the labeled transformed-source-domain  data may not be useful for the target domain. In this paper, we present a new transfer learning framework called Hybrid Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (HHTL), which allows the corresponding instances across domains to be biased in either the source or target domain.

309,2014,Main Track: Planning and Scheduling,Flexible and Scalable Partially Observable Planning with Linear Translations,"Blai Bonet, Hector Geffner","The problem of on-line planning in partially observable settings involves two problems: keeping track of beliefs about the environment and selecting actions for achieving goals. While the two problems are computationally intractable in the worst case, significant progress has been achieved in recent years through the use of suitable reductions. In particular, the state-of-the-art CLG planner is based on a translation that maps deterministic partially observable problems into fully observable non-deterministic ones. The translation, which is quadratic in the number of problem fluents and gets rid of the belief tracking problem, is adequate for most benchmarks, and it is in fact complete for problems that have width 1. The more recent K-replanner uses translations that are linear, one for keeping track of beliefs and the other for selecting actions using off-the-shelf classical planners. As a result, the K-replanner scales up better but it is not as general. In this work, we combine the benefits of the two approaches - the scope of the CLG planner and the efficiency of the Kreplanner. The new planner, called LW1, is based on a translation that is linear but complete for width-1 problems. The scope and scalability of the new planner is evaluated experimentally by considering the existing benchmarks and new problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8642/8683,Contingent Planning; POMDP; Belief Tracking; Action Selection; Completeness; Width;
310,2014,Main Track: Planning and Scheduling,Using Timed Game Automata to Synthesize Execution Strategies for Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty,"Alessandro Cimatti, Luke Hunsberger, Andrea Micheli, Marco Roveri",A Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) is a structure for representing and reasoning about temporal constraints in domains where some temporal durations are not controlled by the executor. The most important property of an STNU is whether it is dynamically controllable (DC) whether there exists a strategy for executing the controllable time-points that guarantees that all constraints will be satisfied no matter how the uncontrollable durations turn out. This paper provides a novel mapping from STNUs to Timed Game Automata (TGAs) that: (1) explicates the deep theoretical relationships between STNUs and TGAs; and (2) enables the memoryless strategies generated from the TGA to be transformed into equivalent STNU execution strategies that reduce the real-time computational burden for the executor. The paper formally proves that the STNU-to-TGA encoding properly captures the execution semantics of STNUs.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8512/8684,Temporal reasoning; Simple Temporal Problems with Uncertainty; Dynamic Controllability; Timed Game Automata; Strategy Synthesis

Functions defining the model as well as intermediate calculations are valued in a finite possibilistic scale L, which induces a finite belief state space under partial observability contrary to its probabilistic counterpart. In this paper, we propose the first study of factored pi-MOMDP models in order to solve large structured planning problems under qualitative uncertainty, or considered as qualitative approximations of probabilistic problems. Building upon the SPUDD algorithm for solving factored (probabilistic) MDPs, we conceived a symbolic algorithm named PPUDD for solving factored pi-MOMDPs. Whereas SPUDD's decision diagrams' leaves may be as large as the state space since their values are real numbers aggregated through additions and multiplications, PPUDD's ones always remain in the finite scale L via min and max operations only. Our experiments show that PPUDD's computation time is much lower than SPUDD, Symbolic-HSVI and APPL for possibilistic and probabilistic versions of the same benchmarks under either total or mixed observability, while still providing high-quality policies.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8553/8686,Qualitative Planning under Uncertainty; Symbolic Planning with Decision Diagrams; Possibilistic POMDPs; Mixed Observability

Williams","Scheduling under uncertainty is essential to many autonomous systems and logistics tasks. Probabilistic methods for solving temporal problems exist which quantify and attempt to minimize the probability of schedule failure. These methods are overly conservative, resulting in a loss in schedule utility. Chance constrained formalism address over-conservatism by imposing bounds on risk, while maximizing utility subject to these risk bounds. In this paper we present the probabilistic Simple Temporal Network (pSTN), a probabilistic formalism for representing temporal problems with bounded risk and a utility over event timing. We introduce a constrained optimisation algorithm for pSTNs that achieves compactness and efficiency through a problem encoding in terms of a parameterised STNU and its reformulation as a parameterised STN.

The idea of the Domain Predictive Control (DPC) approach is to generate input signals affecting both the numerical states and the modes of the system by stringing together atomic actions to a logically consistent plan. However, the existing DPC approach is restricted in the sense that a discrete and pre-defined input signal is required for each action. In this paper, we extend the approach to deal with symbolic states. This allows for the propagation of reachable regions of the state space emerging from actions with inputs that can be arbitrarily chosen within specified input bounds. This symbolic extension enables the applicability of DPC to systems with bounded inputs sets and increases its robustness due to the implicitly reduced search space. Moreover, precise numeric goal states instead of goal regions become reachable.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8237/8694,domain predictive control; hybrid domains; dynamic systems;

Recent work on generating plans for partially observable domains has advocated for online planning, claiming that offline plans are often too large to generate. Here we push the envelope on this challenging problem, proposing a technique for generating conditional (aka contingent) plans offline. The key to our planner's success is the reliance on state-of-the-art techniques for fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning. In particular, we use an existing compilation for converting a planning problem under partial observability and sensing to a FOND planning problem.

Examples of these actions include picking fruit in agriculture, pick-and-place tasks in manufacturing and search patterns in robotic search or survey missions. These looping actions often have a range of acceptable values for the number of loops and a preference function over them. For example, during robotic survey missions, the information gain is expected to increase with the number of loops in a search pattern. Since these looping actions also take time, which is typically bounded, there is a challenge of maximizing utility while respecting time constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Looping Temporal Problem with Preference (LTPP) as a simple parameterized extension of a simple temporal problem. In addition, we introduce a scheduling algorithm for LTPPs which leverages the structure of the problem to find the optimal solution efficiently.

Brafman","Conformant probabilistic planning (CPP) differs from conformant planning (CP) by two key elements: the initial belief state is probabilistic,and the conformant plan must achieve the goal with probability $\geq\theta$, for some $0<\theta\leq 1$. In earlier work we observed that one can reduce CPP to CP by finding a set of initial states whose probability $\geq\theta$, for whicha conformant plan exists. In previous solvers we used the underlying planner to select this set of states and to plan for them simultaneously. Here we suggest an alternative approach: start with relevance analysis to determine a promising set of initial states on which to focus. Then, call an off-the-shelf conformant planner to solve the resulting problem. This approach has a number of advantages. First, instead of depending on the heuristic function to select the set of initial states,we can introduce specific, efficient relevance reasoning techniques. Second, we can benefit from optimizations used by conformant planners that are unsound when applied to the original CPP. Finally, we are free to use any existing (or new) CP solver.

Here, flexibility roughly refers to the freedom in choosing suitable values for the variables in order to satisfy the constraints. In this paper, we concentrate on linear constraint systems and efficient decomposition techniques for them. Using a generalization of a flexibility metric developed for Simple Temporal Networks, we show how an efficient decomposition technique for linear constraint systems can be derived that minimizes the loss of flexibility.

One major weakness of GBFS is its behavior in so-called uninformative heuristic regions (UHRs) - parts of the search space in which no heuristic provides guidance towards states with improved heuristic values. This work analyzes the problem of UHRs in planning in detail, and proposes a two level search framework as a solution. In Greedy Best-First Search with Local Exploration (GBFS-LE), a local exploration is started from within a global GBFS whenever the search seems stuck in UHRs. Two different local exploration strategies are developed and evaluated experimentally: Local GBFS (LS) and Local Random Walk Search (LRW). The two new planners LAMA-LS and LAMA-LRW integrate these strategies into the GBFS component of LAMA-2011.

Successful techniques include extra queues based on Helpful Actions (or Preferred Operators), as well as using Multiple Heuristics. One weakness of all standard GBFS algorithms is their lack of exploration. All queues used in these methods work as priority queues sorted by heuristic values. Therefore, misleading heuristics, especially early in the search process, can cause the search to become ineffective. Type systems, as introduced for heuristic search by Lelis et al, are a development of ideas for exploration related to the classic stratified sampling approach. The current work introduces a search algorithm that utilizes type systems in a new way – for exploration within a GBFS multiqueue framework in satisficing planning. A careful case study shows the benefits of such exploration for overcoming deficiencies of the heuristic. The proposed new baseline algorithm Type-GBFS solves almost 200 more problems than baseline GBFS over all International Planning Competition problems.

Such models often exhibit considerable symmetry, and it is a challenge to devise algorithms that exploit this symmetry to speed up inference. Recently, the automorphism group has been proposed to formalize mathematically what ""exploiting symmetry"" means. However, obtaining symmetry derived from automorphism is GI-hard, and consequently only a small fraction of the symmetry is easily available for effective employment. In this paper, we improve upon efficiency in two ways. First, we introduce the Cluster Signature Graph (CSG), a platform on which greater portions of the symmetries can be revealed and exploited. CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8322/8706,

Barreto,"Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) stands out among reinforcement learning algorithms for its flexibility and ease of use. FQI can be combined with any regression method, and this choice determines the algorithm's statistical and computational properties. The combination of FQI with an ensemble of regression trees gives rise to an algorithm, FQIT, that is computationally efficient, scalable to high dimensional spaces, and robust to noise. Despite its nice properties and good performance in practice, FQIT also has some limitations: the fact that an ensemble of trees must be constructed (or updated) at each iteration confines the algorithm to the batch scenario. This paper aims to address this specific issue. Based on a strategy recently proposed in the literature, called the stochastic-factorization trick, we propose a modification of FQIT that makes it fully incremental, and thus suitable for on-line learning. We call the resulting method tree-based stochastic factorization (TBSF). We derive upper bounds for the difference between the value functions computed by FQIT and TBSF, and also show in which circumstances the approximations coincide. A series of computational experiments is presented to illustrate the properties of TBSF and to show its usefulness in practice, including a medical problem involving the treatment of patients infected with HIV.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8339/8708,Reinforcement Learning; Markov Decision Processes; Fitted Q-Iteration; Regression Trees; Stochastic Factorization

These constraints, if not satisfied in the data, allow us to reject or modify the model. Most common methods of testing a linear structural equation model (SEM) rely on the likelihood ratio or chi-square test which simultaneously tests all of the restrictions implied by the model. Local constraints, on the other hand, offer increased power (Bollen and Pearl, 2013; McDonald, 2002) and, in the case of failure, provide the modeler with insight for revising the model specification. One strategy of uncovering local constraints in linear SEMs is to search for overidentified path coefficients. While these overidentifying constraints are well known, no method has been given for systematically discovering them. In this paper, we extend the half-trek criterion of (Foygel et al., 2012) to identify a larger set of structural coefficients and use it to systematically discover overidentifying constraints.

These algorithms can, however, perform poorly in MDPs with high stochastic branching factors. In this paper, we study state aggregation as a way of reducing stochastic branching in tree search. Prior work has studied formal properties of MDP state aggregation in the context of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, but little attention has been paid to state aggregation in MCTS. Our main result is a performance loss bound for a class of value function-based state aggregation criteria in expectimax search trees. We also consider how to construct MCTS algorithms that operate in the abstract state space but require a simulator of the ground dynamics only. We find that trajectory sampling algorithms like UCT can be adapted easily, but that sparse sampling algorithms present difficulties.

But these approaches are not directly applicable to relational domains due to their reliance on a feature vector or a distance measure. We propose a non-parametric relational one-class classification approach based on first-order trees. We learn a tree-based distance measure that iteratively introduces new relational features to differentiate relational examples. We update the distance measure so as to maximize the one-class classification performance of our model. We also relate our model definition to existing work on probabilistic combination functions and density estimation. We experimentally show that our approach can discover relevant features and outperform three baseline approaches.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8578/8713,One-class classification; Statistical Relational Learning; Ensemble learning; Relational Distance Metric

No single algorithm dominates the others in speed, and, given a problem instance, it is a priori unclear which algorithm will perform best and how fast it will solve the problem. Estimating the runtimes directly is extremely difficult as they are complicated functions of the instance. The main contribution of this paper is characterization of the empirical hardness of an instance for a given algorithm based on a novel collection of non-trivial, yet efficiently computable features. Our empirical results, based on the largest evaluation of state-of-the-art BNS learning algorithms to date, demonstrate that we can predict the runtimes to a reasonable degree of accuracy, and effectively select algorithms that perform well on a particular instance.

The assumption that an infinite sequence of data points is exchangeable is at the core of Bayesian statistics. However, finite exchangeability as a statistical property that renders probabilistic inference tractable is less well-understood. We develop a theory of finite exchangeability and its relation to tractable probabilistic inference. The theory is complementary to that of independence and conditional independence. We show that tractable inference in probabilistic models with high treewidth and millions of variables can be explained with the notion of finite (partial) exchangeability.

Our approach and tool, called R2, has the unique feature of employing program analysis in order to improve the efficiencyof MCMC sampling. Given an input program P, R2 propagates observations in P backwards to obtaina semantically equivalent program P' in which every probabilistic assignment is immediately followed by an observe statement. Inference is performed by a suitably modified version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that exploits the structure of the program P'. This has the overall effect of preventing rejections due to program executions that fail to satisfy observations in P. We formalize the semantics of probabilistic programs and rigorously prove the correctness of R2.

Accordingly, an agent maximizes a regularized expected utility known as the free energy, where the regularizer is given by the information divergence from a prior to a posterior policy. While this approach can be justified in various ways, including from statistical mechanics and information theory, it is still unclear how it relates to decision-making against adversarial environments. This connection has previously been suggested in work relating the free energy to risk-sensitive control and to extensive form games. Here, we show that a single-agent free energy optimization is equivalent to a game between the agent and an imaginary adversary.  The adversary can, by paying an exponential penalty, generate costs that diminish the decision maker's payoffs. It turns out that the optimal strategy of the adversary consists in choosing costs so as to render the decision maker indifferent among its choices, which is a definining property of a Nash equilibrium, thus tightening the connection between free energy optimization and game theory.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8550/8717,bounded rationality; free energy; game theory; Legendre-Fenchel transform

345,2014,Main Track: Reasoning under Uncertainty,Approximate Lifting Techniques for Belief Propagation,"Parag Singla, Aniruddh Nath, Pedro M. Domingos","Many AI applications need to explicitly represent relational structure as well as handle uncertainty. First order probabilistic models combine the power of logic and probability to deal with such domains. A naive approach to inference in these models is to propositionalize the whole theory and carry out the inference on the ground network. Lifted inference techniques (such as lifted belief propagation; Singla and Domingos 2008) provide a more scalable approach to inference by combining together groups of objects which behave identically. In many cases, constructing the lifted network can itself be quite costly. In addition, the exact lifted network is often very close in size to the fully propositionalized model. To overcome these problems, we present approximate lifted inference, which groups together similar but distinguishable objects and treats them as if they were identical. Early stopping terminates the execution of the lifted network construction at an early stage resulting in a coarser network. Noise-tolerant hypercubes allow for marginal errors in the representation of the lifted network itself. Both of our algorithms can significantly speed up the process of lifted network construction as well as result in much smaller models. The coarseness of the approximation can be adjusted depending on the accuracy required, and we can bound the resulting error. Extensive evaluation on six domains demonstrates great efficiency gains with only minor (or no) loss in accuracy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8490/8719,Statistical Relational AI; Lifted Inference; Approximate Inference

Formally, we consider problems that are a subset of the well known Decentralized MDP (DEC-MDP) model, where the anonymity in interactions is specified within the joint reward and transition functions.

A POMDP solution is often represented by a value function comprised of a set of vectors. In the case of factored models, the size of these vectors grows exponentially with the number of state factors, leading to scalability issues. We consider an approximate value function representation based on a linear combination of basis functions. In particular, we present a backup operator that can be used in any point-based POMDP solver.

Physics-based simulators are commonly used to plan stable grasps for man-made objects. However, planning is an expensive process that is based on simulating hand and object trajectories in different configurations, and evaluating the outcome of each trajectory. This problem is particularly concerning when the objects are irregular or cluttered, because the space of feasible grasps is significantly smaller, and more configurations need to be evaluated before finding a good one. In this paper, we first present a learning technique for fast detection of an initial set of potentially stable grasps in a cluttered scene. The best detected grasps are further optimized by fine-tuning the configuration of the hand in simulation. To reduce the computational burden of this last operation, we model the outcomes of the grasps as a Gaussian Process, and use an entropy-search method in order to focus the optimization on regions where the best grasp is most likely to be. This approach is tested on the task of clearing piles of real, unknown, rock debris with an autonomous robot.

By instantiating the backdoor variables one reduces the given instance to several easy instances that belong to a tractable class.The overall time needed to solve the instance is exponential in the size of the backdoor set, hence it is a challenging problem to find a small backdoor set if one exists; over the last years this problem has been subject of intensive research. In this paper we extend the classical notion of a strong backdoor set by allowing that different instantiations of the backdoor variables result in instances that belong to different base classes; the union of the base classes forms a heterogeneous base class.  Backdoor sets to heterogeneous base classes can be much smaller than backdoor sets to homogeneous ones, hence they are much more desirable but possibly harder to find. We draw a detailed complexity landscape for the problem of detecting strong backdoor sets into heterogeneous base classes for SAT and CSP.

The soft clauses are relaxed via the addition of blocking variables, and the total weight of soft clauses that can be relaxed is limited by placing constraints on the blocking variables. In this work we propose an alternative approach. Our approach also builds a sequence of new SAT formulas. However, these formulas are constructed using MAXSAT resolution, a sound rule of inference for MAXSAT. MAXSAT resolution can in the worst case cause a quadratic blowup in the formula, so we propose a new compressed version of MAXSAT resolution.

377,2014,Main Track: Search and Constraint Satisfaction,Avoiding Plagiarism in Markov Sequence Generation,"Alexandre Papadopoulos, Pierre Roy, François Pachet","Markov processes are widely used to generate sequences that imitate a given style, using random walk. Random walk generates sequences by iteratively concatenating states to prefixes of length equal or less than the given Markov order}. However, at higher orders, Markov chains tend to replicate chunks of the corpus with a size possibly higher than the order, a primary form of plagiarism. The Markov order defines a maximum length for training but not for generation. In the framework of constraint satisfaction (CSP), we introduce MaxOrder. This global constraint ensures that generated sequences do not include chunks larger than a given maximum order. We exhibit an automaton that recognises the solution set, with a size linear in the size of the corpus. We propose a linear-time procedure to generate this automaton from a corpus and a given max order. We then use this automaton to achieve generalised arc consistency for the MaxOrder constraint, holding on a sequence of size n, in O(n.T) time, where T is the size of the automaton. We illustrate our approach by generating text sequences from text corpora with a maximum order guarantee, effectively controlling plagiarism.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8574/8741,markov chains; constraint programming; music generation; automatic content generation; plagiarism; max order

379,2014,Main Track: Vision,Exploiting Competition Relationship for Robust Visual Recognition,"Liang Du, Haibin Ling","Joint learning of similar tasks has been a popular trend in visual recognition and proven to be beneficial. Between-task similarity often provides useful cues, such as feature sharing, for learning visual classifiers. By contrast, the competition relationship between visual recognition tasks (e.g., content independent writer identification and handwriting recognition) remains largely under-explored. A key challenge in visual recognition is to select the most discriminating features and remove irrelevant features related to intra-class variations. With the help of auxiliary competing tasks, we can identify such features within a joint learning model exploiting the competition relationship.Motivated by this intuition, we propose a novel way to exploit competition relationship for solving visual recognition problems. Specifically, given a target task and its competing tasks, we jointly model them by a generalized additive regression model with a competition constraint. This constraint effectively discourages choosing of irrelevant features (weak learners) that support the auxiliary competing tasks. We name the proposed algorithm  CompBoost. In our study, CompBoost is applied to two visual recognition applications: (1) content-independent writer identification from handwriting scripts by exploiting competing tasks of handwriting recognition, and (2) actor-independent facial expression recognition by exploiting competing tasks of face recognition. In both experiments our approach demonstrates promising performance gains by exploiting the between-task competition.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8449/8624,Transfer Learning; Visual Recognition; Competing Tasks

In this paper, first we define pairwise angular similarity and angular distance for linear subspaces. The angular distance satisfies non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and triangle inequality, and thus it is a metric. Then we propose a method to compress linear subspaces into compact similarity-preserving binary signatures, between which the normalized Hamming distance is an unbiased estimator of the angular distance. We provide a lower bound on the length of the binary signatures which suffices to guarantee uniform distance-preservation within a set of subspaces. Experiments on face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the binary signature in terms of recognition accuracy, speed and storage requirement. The results show that, compared with the exact method, the approximation with the binary signatures achieves an order of magnitude speed-up, while requiring significantly smaller amount of storage space, yet it still accurately preserves the similarity, and achieves high recognition accuracy comparable to the exact method in face recognition.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8225/8627,linear subspace;binary signature

As a result, the foreground object can be automatically separated from the background in a fully unsupervised way.

Following the standard bag-of-words (BOW) pipeline, when coding the data matrix in the sense of low-rankness incorporates contextual information into the traditional BOW model, this can capture the dependency relationship among neighbor patches. It differs from the traditional sparse coding paradigms which encode patches independently. Current LRC-based methods use l_1 norm to increase the discrimination and sparseness of the learned codes. However, such methods fail to consider the local manifold structure between dataspace and dictionary space. To solve this problem, we propose a locality-constrained low-rank coding (LCLR) algorithm for image representations. By using the geometric structure information as a regularization term,we can obtain more discriminative representations. In addition, we present a fast and stable online algorithmto solve the optimization problem. In the experiments,we evaluate LCLR with four benchmarks, including one face recognition dataset (extended Yale B), one handwrittendigit recognition dataset (USPS), and two image datasets (Scene13 for scene recognition and Caltech101 for object recognition).

Due to sparse characteristic of data in real-world applications, DL uses a set of learned dictionary bases to represent the linear decomposition of a data point. Fisher discrimination DL (FDDL) is a representative supervised DL method, which constructs a structured dictionary whose atoms correspond to the class labels. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in multi-view (more than two views) feature learning techniques. Although some multi-view (or multi-modal) DL methods have been presented, there still exists much room for improvement. How to enhance the total discriminability of dictionaries and reduce their redundancy is a crucial research topic. To boost the performance of multi-view DL technique, we propose an uncorrelated multi-view discrimination DL (UMDDL) approach for recognition. By making dictionary atoms correspond to the class labels such that the obtained reconstruction error is discriminative, UMDDL aims to jointly learn multiple dictionaries with totally favorable discriminative power.

Specifically, low-rank matrix approximation can handle the possible contamination of data. Moreover, the classwise block-diagonal structure is exploited to promote discrimination of representations for robust recognition.

393,2014,Main Track: Vision,Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Spatio-Temporal Consistency,"Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang","Video completion is a computer vision technique to recover the missing values in video sequences by filling the unknown regions with the known information. In recent research, tensor completion, a generalization of matrix completion for higher order data, emerges as a new solution to estimate the missing information in video with the assumption that the video frames are homogenous and correlated. However, each video clip often stores the heterogeneous episodes and the correlations among all video frames are not high. Thus, the regular tenor completion methods are not suitable to recover the video missing values in practical applications. To solve this problem, we propose a novel spatially-temporally consistent tensor completion method for recovering the video missing data. Instead of minimizing the average of the trace norms of all matrices unfolded along each mode of a tensor data, we introduce a new smoothness regularization along video time direction to utilize the temporal information between consecutive video frames. Meanwhile, we also minimize the trace norm of each individual video frame to employ the spatial correlations among pixels. Different to previous tensor completion approaches, our new method can keep the spatio-temporal consistency in video and do not assume the global correlation in video frames. Thus, the proposed method can be applied to the general and practical video completion applications.

Existing studies pay main attention to the formulation of the weakly-supervised learning problem, i.e., how to propagate class labels from images to regions given an affinity graph of regions. Notably, however, the affinity graph of regions, which is generally constructed in relatively simpler settings in existing methods, is of crucial importance to the parsing performance due to the fact that the weakly-supervised parsing problem cannot be solved within a single image, and that the affinity graph enables label propagation among multiple images. In order to embed more semantics into the affinity graph, we propose novel criteria by exploiting the weak supervision information carefully, and develop two graphs: L1 semantic graph and k-NN semantic graph.

Corso","To improve robustness to significant mismatches between source domain and target domain - arising from changes such as illumination, pose and image quality - domain adaptation is increasingly popular in computer vision. But most of methods assume that the source data is from single domain, or that multi-domain datasets provide the domain label for training instances. In practice, most datasets are mixtures of multiple latent domains, and difficult to manually provide the domain label of each data point. In this paper, we propose a model that automatically discovers latent domains in visual datasets. We first assume the visual images are sampled from multiple manifolds, each of which represents different domain, and which are represented by different subspaces. Using the neighborhood structure estimated from images belonging to the same category, we approximate the local linear invariant subspace for each image based on its local structure, eliminating the category-specific elements of the feature. Based on the effectiveness of this representation, we then propose a squared-loss mutual information based clustering model with category distribution prior in each domain to infer the domain assignment for images. In experiment, we test our approach on two common image datasets, the results show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, and also show the superiority of multiple latent domain discovery.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8418/8641,Latent Domain Discovery; Clustering; Domain Adaptation
396,2014,Main Track: Vision,Semantic Segmentation Using Multiple Graphs with Block-Diagonal Constraints,"Ke Zhang, Wei Zhang, Sheng Zeng, Xiangyang Xue","In this paper we propose a novel method for image semantic segmentation using multiple graphs. The multiview affinity graph is constructed by leveraging the consistency between semantic space and multiple visualspaces. With block-diagonal constraints, we enforce the affinity matrix to be sparse such that the pairwise potential for dissimilar superpixels is close to zero. By a divide-and-conquer strategy, the optimizationfor learning affinity matrix is decomposed into several subproblems that can be solved in parallel. Using the neighborhood relationship between superpixels and the consistency between affinity matrix and labelconfidencematrix, we infer the semantic label for each superpixel of unlabeled images by minimizing an objective whose closed form solution can be easily obtained.

397,2014,Main Track: Vision,Locality Preserving Hashing,"Kang Zhao, Hongtao Lu, Jincheng Mei","Hashing has recently attracted considerable attention for large scale similarity search. However, learning compact codes with good performance is still a challenge. In many cases, the real-world data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. To capture meaningful neighbors, a compact hashing representation should be able to uncover the intrinsic geometric structure of the manifold, e.g., the neighborhood relationships between subregions. Most existing hashing methods only consider this issue during mapping data points into certain projected dimensions. When getting the binary codes, they either directly quantize the projected values with a threshold, or use an orthogonal matrix to refine the initial projection matrix, which both consider projection and quantization separately, and will not well preserve the locality structure in the whole learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing algorithm called Locality Preserving Hashing to effectively solve the above problems. Specifically, we learn a set of locality preserving projections with a joint optimization framework, which minimizes the average projection distance and quantization loss simultaneously. Experimental comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on two large scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8357/8643,Similarity Search;Binary Codes;Locality Preserving Hashing

A positive conversion event occurs when a user fills out and submits a lead form interstitial. We used machine learning to identify which users might want to fill out lead forms, and where in their sessions to present the interstitials. There are several factors that make these predictions difficult, such as (a) far more negative than positive responses (b) seasonality effects due to car sales events near holidays, which require the model to be easily tunable and (c) the need for compu- tationally fast predictions for real-time decision-making in order to minimize any impact on the website’s us- ability.

399,2014,Deployed Application Case Studies,Engineering Works Scheduling for Hong Kong’s Rail Network,"Andy Hon Wai Chun, Ted Yiu Tat Suen","This paper describes how AI is used to plan, schedule, and optimize nightly engineering works for both the commuter and rapid transit lines in Hong Kong. The MTR Corporation Limited operates and manages all the rail lines in Hong Kong. Its “Engineering Works and Traffic Information Management System” (ETMS) is a mission critical system that manages all information related to engineering works and their related track possessions and engineering train movements. The AI Engine described in this paper is a component of this ETMS. In Hong Kong, the maintenance, inspection, repair, or installation works along the rail lines are done during the very short non-traffic hours (NTH) of roughly 4 to 5 hours each night. These engineering works can be along the running tracks, track-side, tunnel, freight yards, sub-depots, depot maintenance tracks, etc. The proper scheduling of necessary engineering works is crucial to maintaining a reliable and safe train service during normal hours. The AI Engine optimizes resource allocation to maximize the number of engineering works that can be performed, while ensuring all safety, environment, and operational rules and constraints are met. The work described is part of a project to redesign and replace the existing ETMS, deployed in 2004, with an updated technology platform and modern IT architecture, to provide a more robust and scalable system that potentially can be deployed to other cities around the world.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI14/paper/viewFile/8151/8655,scheduling; optimization; rules; railway

Glasgow","Pattern discovery in protein interaction networks can reveal crucial biological knowledge on the inner workings of cellular machinery. Although far from complete, extracting meaningful patterns from proteomic networks is a non-trivial task due to their size-complexity. This paper proposes a computational framework to efficiently discover topologically-similar patterns from large proteomic networks using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). PSO is a robust and low-cost optimization technique that demonstrated to work effectively on the complex, mostly sparse proteomic networks. The resulting topologically-similar patterns of close proximity are utilized to systematically predict new high-confidence protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The proposed PSO-based PPI prediction method (3PI) managed to predict high-confidence PPIs, validated by more than one computational/experimental source, through a proposed PPI knowledge transfer process between topologically-similar interaction patterns of close proximity. In three case studies, over 50% of the predicted interactions for EFGR, ERBB2, ERBB3, GRB2 and UBC are overlapped with publically available interaction databases, ~80% of the predictions are found among the Top 1% results of another PPI prediction method and their genes are significantly co-expressed across different tissues. Moreover, the only single prediction example that did not overlap with any of our validation sources was recently experimentally supported by two PubMed publications.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI14/paper/viewFile/8125/8661,Multi-Start Particle Swarm Optimization; Pattern Discovery; Proteomic Networks; Protein Interaction Prediction.

To improve the success rates of these later/harder questions, we investigate novel weighted aggregation schemes for aggregating the answers obtained from the crowd.By using weights optimized for reliability of participants (derived from the participants' confidence), we show that we can pull up the accuracy rate for the harder questions by 15%, and to overall 95% average accuracy.Our results provide a good case for the benefits of applying machine learning techniques for building more accurate crowdsourced question answering systems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI14/paper/viewFile/8634/8662,Crowdsourcing; Multiple-choice question answering; AI for games

Goldman, Omer Tsimhoni","Reducing energy consumption of climate control systems is important in order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the climate control system may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the energy consumption of their climate control unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the climate control system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the climate control system as a function of the system's settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the climate control system's settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the climate control system. The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI14/paper/viewFile/8473/8663,Human modeling; advice provision; persuasion

Using these devices is risky and may lead to a tragedy (e.g. fire). A potential solution to this issue is to provide automated systems, which perform tasks on behalf of the patient. However, clinical studies have shown that encouraging users to maintain their autonomy greatly help to preserve health, dignity, and motivation. Therefore, we present in this paper a new smart range prototype allowing monitoring and guiding a cognitively-impaired user in the activity of preparing a meal.

In this paper, we present STREETS, an application developed for the city of Singapore, which models the problem of computing randomized traffic patrol strategies as a defender-attacker Stackelberg game. Previous work on Stackelberg security games has focused extensively on counter-terrorism settings. STREETS moves beyond counter-terrorism and represents the first use of Stackelberg games for traffic patrolling, in the process providing a novel algorithm for solving such games that addresses three major challenges in modeling and scale-up. First, there exists a high degree of unpredictability in travel times through road networks, which we capture using a Markov Decision Process for planning the patrols of the defender (the police) in the game. Second, modeling all possible police patrols and their interactions with a large number of adversaries (drivers) introduces a significant scalability challenge. To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a bi-objective optimization problem. We present experimental results using real-world traffic data from Singapore.

In collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), we work to defend fisheries from illegal fish- erman (henceforth called Lanchas) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We have developed the COmPASS (Conserva- tive Online Patrol ASSistant) system to design USCG patrols against the Lanchas. In this application, we face a population of Lanchas with heterogeneous behavior who fish frequently. We have some data about these Lanchas, but not enough to fit a statistical model. Previ- ous security patrol assistants have focused on counter- terrorism in one-shot games where adversaries are as- sumed to be perfectly rational, and much less data about their behavior is available. COmPASS is novel because: (i) it emphasizes environmental crime; (ii) it is based on a repeated Stackelberg game; (iii) it allows for bounded rationality of the Lanchas and it offers a robust approach against the heterogeneity of the Lancha population; and (iv) it can learn from sparse Lancha data.

We also experimented with using multiple policies, and found that doing so could lead to a further 8% improvement if we could determine which policy to apply at each stop.

The maintenance process usually involves massive numbers of components and substantial procedural knowledge of maintenance procedures. Maintenance tasks require technicians to follow rigorous procedures to prevent operational errors in the maintenance process. In addition, the maintenance time is a cost-sensitive issue for airlines. This paper proposes intelligent augmented reality (IAR) system to minimize operation errors and time-related costs and help aircraft technicians cope with complex tasks by using an intuitive UI/UX interface for their maintenance tasks. The IAR system is composed mainly of three major modules: 1) the AR module 2) the knowledge-based system (KBS) module 3) a unified platform with an integrated UI/UX module between the AR and KBS modules. The AR module addresses vision-based tracking, annotation, and recognition. The KBS module deals with ontology-based resources and context management. Overall testing of the IAR system is conducted at Korea Air Lines (KAL) hangars.

Interestingly, work on these systems shows that even primitive forms of automated oversight on the human contributors helps in significantly improving the effectiveness of the humans/crowd. In this paper, we argue that the automated oversight used in these systems can be viewed as a primitive automated planner, and that there are several opportunities for more sophisticated automated planning in effectively steering the crowd. Straightforward adaptation of current planning technology is however hampered by the mismatch between the capabilities of human workers and automated planners. We identify and partially address two important challenges that need to be overcome before such adaptation of planning technology can occur: (1 interpreting inputs of the human workers (and the requester) and (2) steering or critiquing plans produced by the human workers, armed only with incomplete domain and preference models. To these ends, we describe the implementation of AI-MIX, a tour plan generation system that uses automated checks and alerts to improve the quality of plans created by human workers; and present a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of steering provided by automated planning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI14/paper/viewFile/8576/8671,Automated Planning; Crowdsourcing; Mturk

Species accumulation curves, which plot the number of unique species observed over time, are an effective way to quantify the skill level of an eBird participant. Intuitively, more skilled observers can identify a greater number of species per unit time than inexperienced birders, resulting in a steeper curve.

423,2014,Extended Abstract / Poster,Easychair as a Pedagogical Tool: Engaging Graduate Students in the Reviewing Process,"Kartik Talamadupula, Subbarao Kambhampati","One of the more important aims of graduate artificial intelligence courses is to prepare graduate students to critically evaluate the current literature. The established approaches for this include either asking a student to present a paper in class, or to have the entire class read and discuss a paper. However, neither of these approaches presents incentives for student participation beyond the posting of a single summary or review. In this paper, we describe a class project that uses the popular Easychair conference management system as a pedagogical tool to enable engagement in the peer review process. We report on the deployment of this project in a medium-sized graduate AI class, and present the results of this deployment. We hope that the success of this project in engaging students in the peer review process can be used better train and bolster the future corps of AI reviewers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/EAAI/EAAI14/paper/viewFile/8613/8679,"project, artificial intelligence, peer review, reviewing"

Allen,"Conditional preference networks (CP-nets) exploit the power of conditional ceteris paribus rules to enable a compact representation of human preferences. CP-nets have much appeal. However, the study of CP-nets has not advanced sufficiently for their widespread use in complex, real-world applications. Most studies limit their attention to strict, complete, consistent preferences over binary domains. In my research, I attempt to address these limitations to make CP-nets more useful. I discuss recent research in which we presented a novel algorithm for learning CP-nets from user queries, as well as work showing how to adapt existing algorithms to learn and reason with multivalued CP-nets that can model indifference as well as strict preference. I outline anticipated research to extend our elicitation algorithm to a richer class of CP-nets, develop a formal model of expected flipping sequence length, and learn CP-nets in which a subject prefers to coordinate certain features, leading to a cycle in the dependency graph.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8641/8743,CP-nets; indifference; multivalued features; incomplete preferences

428,2014,Doctoral Consortium,Solving Semantic Problems Using Contexts Extracted from Knowledge Graphs,Adrian Boteanu,"This thesis seeks to address word reasoning problems from a semantic standpoint, proposing a uniform approach for generating solutions while also providing human-understandable explanations. Current state of the art solvers of semantic problems rely on traditional machine learning methods. Therefore their results are not easily reusable by algorithms or interpretable by humans. We propose leveraging web-scale knowledge graphs to determine a semantic frame of interpretation. Semantic knowledge graphs are graphs in which nodes represent concepts and the edges represent the relations between them. Our approach has the following advantages: (1) it reduces the space in which the problem is to be solved; (2) sparse and noisy data can be used without relying only on the relations deducible from the data itself; (3) the output of the inference algorithm is supported by an interpretable justification. We demonstrate our approach in two domains: (1) Topic Modeling: We form topics using connectivity in semantic graphs. We use the same topic models for two very different recommendation systems, one designed for high noise interactive applications and the other for large amounts of web data. (2) Analogy Solving: For humans, analogies are a fundamental reasoning pattern, which relies on abstraction and comparative analysis. In order for an analogy to be understood, precise relations have to be identified and mapped. We introduce graph algorithms to assess the analogy strength in contexts derived from the analogy words. We demonstrate our approach by solving standardized test analogy question.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8411/8746,Semantic; Context; Analogy; Topic

Our approach takes a probabilistic model of trust founded on commitments. We assume commitments to estimate trust because a commitment describes what an agent may expect of another. Therefore, the satisfaction or violation of a commitment provides a natural basis for determining how much to trust another agent. We evaluate our approach empirically. In one study, 30 subjects read emails extracted from the Enron dataset augmented with some synthetic emails to capture commitment operations missing in the Enron corpus. The subjects estimated trust between each pair of communicating participants. We trained model parameters for each subject with respect to our automated analysis of the emails, showing that our trained parameters yield a lower prediction error of a subject's trust rating given automatically inferred commitments than fixed parameters.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8280/8751,"Algorithms, Commitments, Trust,"

436,2014,Doctoral Consortium,Probabilistic Planning with Reduced Models,Luis Enrique Pineda,"Markov decision processes (MDP) offer a rich model that has been extensively used by the AI community for planning and learning under uncertainty. However, solving MDPs is often intractable, which has led to the development of many approximate algorithms. In my dissertation work I introduce a new paradigm to handle this complexity by deﬁning a family of MDP reduced models characterized by two parameters: the maximum number of primary outcomes per action that are fully accounted for and the maximum number of occurrences of the remaining exceptional outcomes that are planned for in advance. Reduced models can be solved much faster using heuristic search algorithms, beneﬁting from the dramatic reduction in the number of reachable states. This framework places recent work on MDP determinization in a broader context and lays the foundation for efﬁcient and systematic exploration of the space of MDP model reductions. Progress so far work includes a formal deﬁnition of this family of MDP reductions, a continual planning paradigm to handle the case when the number of exceptions reaches the maximum allowed, a simple greedy approach to generate good reductions for a given planning domain, and a compilation scheme that generates MDP reductions from a PPDDL description of a planning problem.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8253/8754,Markov Decision Processes; Determinization; Continual Planning; Planning Under Uncertainty

439,2014,Doctoral Consortium,Living and Searching in the World: Object-Based State Estimation for Mobile Robots,Lawson L. S. Wong,"Mobile-manipulation robots performing service tasks in human-centric indoor environments has long been a dream for developers of autonomous agents. Tasks such as cooking and cleaning require interaction with the environment, hence robots need to know relevant aspects of their spatial surroundings. However, unlike the structured settings that industrial robots operate in, service robots typically have little prior information about their environment. Even if this information was given, due to the involvement of many other agents (e.g., humans moving objects), uncertainty in the complete state of the world is inevitable over time. Additionally, most information about the world is irrelevant to any particular task at hand. Mobile manipulation robots therefore need to continuously perform the task of state estimation, using perceptual information to maintain the state, and its uncertainty, of task-relevant aspects of the world. Because indoor tasks frequently require the use of objects, objects should be given critical emphasis in spatial representations for service robots. Compared to occupancy grids and feature-based maps often used in navigation and SLAM, object-based representations are arguably still in their infancy. In my thesis, I propose a representation framework based on objects, their 'semantic' attributes, and their geometric realizations in the physical world.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8627/8757,"State estimation, world modeling"

The human and the agent may share certain goals, but are essentially self-interested. This paper extends selection processes to settings in which the actions available to the human are ordered and thus the user may be influenced by the advice even though he doesn't necessarily follow it exactly. In this work we also consider the case in which the user obtains some observation on the sate of the world. We propose several approaches to model human decision making in such settings. We incorporate these models into two optimization techniques for the agent advice provision strategy. In the first one the agent used a social utility approach which considered the benefits and costs for both agent and person when making suggestions. In the second approach we simplified the human model in order to allow modeling and solving the agent strategy as an MDP. In an empirical evaluation involving human users on AMT, we showed that the social utility approach significantly outperformed the MDP approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8128/8762,Human modeling; advice provision; persuasion

However, they also face the risk of exposing sensitive or confidential information, when data is shared among different organizations. Thus, a question arise: how can we prevent that sensitive knowledge is discovered, while ensuring that ordinary non-sensitive knowledge can be mined to the maximum extent possible. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving in association rule mining from the perspective of multi-objective optimization. A new hiding method based evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) is proposed and the side effects generated by the hiding process are formulated as optimization goals. EMO is used to find candidate transactions to modify so that side effects are minimized. Comparative experiments with exact methods on real datasets demonstrated that the proposed method can hide sensitive rules with fewer side effects.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8564/8764,"Association rule hiding, evolutionary multi-objective optimization, EMO"

As an effective approach, iterative improvement workflow is known to choose the best result from multiple workflows. However, for complex crowdsourcing tasks that consists of a certain number of subtasks under some specific constraints, but cannot be split into subtasks to be crowdsourced, the approach merely considers the best workflow without integrating the contributions of all workflows, which potentially results in extra costs for more iterations.

449,2014,Student Abstracts,Addressing Complexity in Multi-Issue Negotiation via Utility Hypergraphs,"Rafik Hadfi, Takayuki Ito","There has been a great deal of interest about negotiations having interdependent issues and nonlinear utility spaces as they arise in many realistic situations. In this case, reaching a consensus among agents becomes more difficult as the search space and the complexity of the problem grow. Nevertheless, none of the proposed approaches tries to quantitatively assess the complexity of the scenarios in hand, or to exploit the topology of the utility space necessary to concretely tackle the complexity and the scaling issues. We address these points by adopting a representation that allows a modular decomposition of the issues and constraints by mapping the utility space into an issue-constraint hypergraph. Exploring the utility space reduces then to a message passing mechanism along the hyperedges by means of utility propagation. Adopting such representation paradigm will allow us to rigorously show how complexity arises in nonlinear scenarios. To this end, we use the concept of information entropy in order to measure the complexity of the hypergraph. Being able to assess complexity allows us to improve the message passing algorithm by adopting a low-complexity propagation scheme. We evaluated our model using parametrized random hyper- graphs, showing that it can optimally handle complex utility spaces while outperforming previous sampling approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8563/8767,Multi-issue Negotiation; Interdependence; Nonlinear Utility; Constraint-based utility spaces; Complexity; Hyper-Graph; Max-Sum; Utility Propagation

The majority of research in this domain has been from the perspective of reinforcement learning (function approximation) and neuroevolution. One of the challenges under multi-agent tasks such as keepaway is to formulate effective mechanisms for diversity maintenance. Indeed the best results to date on this task utilize some form of neuroevolution with genotypic diversity. In this work, a symbiotic framework for evolving teams of programs is utilized with both genotypic and behavioural forms of diversity maintenance considered. Specific contributions of this work include a simple scheme for characterizing genotypic diversity under teams of programs and its comparison to behavioural formulations for diversity under the keepaway soccer task.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we designed a novel single-DBN generative model that ensures that the task of probabilistic inference is equivalent to the original problem of optimizing POMDP controllers, and (2) we developed several inference approaches to approximate the value of the policy when exact inference methods are not tractable to solve large-size problems with complex graphical models.

When objectives cannot all be satisfied, classical planning returns no plan. In partial satisfaction planning, it is possible to satisfy only a subset of the objectives. To solve this kind of problems, an agent could select the objectives subset and the plan that maximizes the net benefit, i.e. the sum of satisfied objectives utilities minus the sum of the cost of actions. This approach has been experimented for deterministic planning. This paper extends partial satisfaction planning for problems with uncertainty on time. For problems under uncertainty, the best subset of objectives may not be calculated at planning time. The effective duration of actions at execution time may dynamically influence the achievable subset of objectives. Our approach introduces special actions to explicitly abort objectives. This enables control on when an objective is aborted.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8283/8771,Planning

In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying domain-dependent influential users(or topic experts). Some of traditional approaches are based on the post contents of users user’s to identify influential users, which may be biased by spammers who try to make posts related to some topics through a simple copy and paste. Others make use of user authentication information given by a service platform or user self description (introduction or label) in finding influential users. However, what users have published is not necessarily related to what they have registed and described. In addition, if there is no comments from other users, it’s less objective to assess a user’s post quality. To improve effectiveness of recognizing influential users in a topic of microblogs, we propose a post-feature based approach which is supplementary to post-content based approaches.

However, there is no prevention forthe cases in which a buyer misjudges a seller, and provides a negative rating to an original satisfactory transaction. In this case,how should the seller get his reputation repaired andutility loss recovered? In this work, we propose a mechanism to mitigate the negativeeffect of the misreported ratings. It temporarily inflates the reputation of thevictim seller with a certain value for a period of time. This allows the seller to recover hisutility loss due to lost opportunities caused by the misreported ratings. Experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8296/8776,
459,2014,Student Abstracts,Reputation-Aware Continuous Double Auction,"Yuan Liu, Jie Zhang, Han Yu, Chunyan Miao","Truthful bidding is a desirable property for continuous double auctions (CDAs). Many incentive mechanisms have been proposed to elicit truthful bids. However, existing truthful CDA mechanisms often overlook the possibility that sellers may choose not to deliver the auctioned items to buyers as promised. In this situation, buyers may become unwilling to bid their true valuations in the future to compensate for their risks of being cheated, thereby rendering CDAs ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation-aware CDA (named RCDA) mechanism to consider the honesty of auction participants. It dynamically adjusts bids and asks according to the reputation of participants to reflect the risks involved in the transactions. Theoretical analysis proves that RCDA is effective in eliciting truthful bids from buyers and sellers in the presence of possible dishonest behavior from both buyers and sellers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8297/8777,

Our approach enables an autonomous RL agent to accumulate knowledge over its lifetime and efficiently share this knowledge between tasks to accelerate learning. Rather than learning a policy for a reinforcement learning task tabula rasa, as in standard GTD, our approach rapidly learns a high performance policy by building upon the agent's previously learned knowledge. Our preliminary results on controlling different mountain car tasks demonstrates that GTD-ELLA significantly improves learning over standard GTD(0).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8610/8782,online multi-task learning; lifelong learning; reinforcement learning; gradient temporal-difference learning

466,2014,Student Abstracts,"A Model Attention and Selection Framework for Estimation of Many Variables, with Applications to Estimating Object States in Large Spatial Environments",Lawson L.S. Wong,"Robots performing service tasks such as cooking and cleaning in human-centric environments require knowledge of certain environmental states in order to complete tasks successfully. While much effort has gone into developing various estimators for deriving distributions on values of unknown states, less attention has been placed on why the particular estimation problem arises. In this work, I argue that state estimation should no longer be treated as a black box. Estimating large sets of variables is computationally costly; just because a technique exists to estimate the values of certain variables does not justify its application. For robots whose ultimate mission is to complete tasks, only variables that are relevant to successful completion should be estimated. I propose to initially only track a minimal set of directly-relevant variables (attention), and gradually increase the sophistication of models on-demand (refinement), in a local fashion. This estimator refinement process is triggered by violations in expectations of task success (mismatch). This model selection framework is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept case study.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8652/8784,"State estimation, model selection"

468,2014,Student Abstracts,Uncovering Hidden Structure through Parallel Problem Decomposition,"Yexiang Xue, Stefano Ermon, Carla Gomes, Bart Selman","A key strategy for speeding up computation is to run in parallel on  multiple cores. However, on hard combinatorial problems, exploiting  parallelism has been surprisingly challenging. It appears that  traditional divide-and-conquer strategies do not work well, due to  the intricate non-local nature of the interactions between the  problem variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel way in which parallelism can be  used to exploit hidden structure of hard combinatorial problems. We  demonstrate the success of this approach on minimal set basis  problem, which has a wide range of applications in machine learning  and system security, etc. We also show the effectiveness on a related application problem from materials discovery. In our approach, a large number of smaller sub-problems are identified and solved concurrently. We then aggregate the information from those solutions, and use this to initialize the search of a global, complete solver. We show that this strategy leads to a significant speed-up over a sequential approach. The  strategy also greatly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete solvers in terms of solution quality. Our work opens up a novel angle for using parallelism to solve hard combinatorial problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8340/8786,Combinatorial Search; Parallel Algorithm; NP-complete Problem; Set Basis Problem

Inspired by the analogies between words and lymphocytes, a lymphocyte-style word representation is proposed. The word representation is built on the basis of dependency syntax of sentences and represent word context as head properties and dependent properties of the word. Lymphocyte-style word representations are evaluated by computing the similarities between words, and experiments are conducted on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1.

470,2014,Student Abstracts,Data Clustering by Laplacian Regularized L1-Graph,"Yingzhen Yang, Zhangyang Wang, Jianchao Yang, Jiangping Wang, Shiyu Chang, Thomas S Huang","L1-Graph has been proven to be effective in data clustering, which partitions the data space by using the sparse representation of the data as the similarity measure. However, the sparse representation is performed for each datum separately without taking into account the geometric structure of the data. Motivated by L1-Graph and manifold leaning, we propose Laplacian Regularized L1-Graph (LRℓ1-Graph) for data clustering. The sparse representations of LRℓ1-Graph are regularized by the geometric information of the data so that they vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold by the graph Laplacian according to the manifold assumption. Moreover, we propose an iterative regularization scheme, where the sparse representation obtained from the previous iteration is used to build the graph Laplacian for the current iteration of regularization. The experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared to L1-Graph and other competing clustering methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8275/8787,Clustering; Manifold Assumption; Laplacian Regularized L1-Graph
