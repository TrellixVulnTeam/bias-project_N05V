Frisch, Brahim Hnich","In constraint solving, a critical bottleneck is the formulation of aneffective constraint model of an input problem. The Conjure system describedin this paper, a substantial step forward over prototype versions of Conjurepreviously reported, makes a valuable contribution to the automation ofconstraint modelling by automatically producing constraint models from theirspecifications in the abstract constraint specification language Essence. Aset of rules is used to refine an abstract specification into a concreteconstraint model. We demonstrate that this set of rules is readily extensibleto increase the space of possible constraint models Conjure can produce. Ourempirical results confirm that Conjure can reproduce successfully the kernelsof the constraint models of 32 benchmark problems found in the literature.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3687/3830,
1,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Optimal Graph Search with Iterated Graph Cuts,"David Burkett, David Hall, Dan Klein","Informed search algorithms such as A* use heuristics to focus exploration on states with low total path cost. To the extent that heuristics underestimate forward costs, a wider cost radius of suboptimal states will be explored. For many weighted graphs, however, a small distance in terms of cost may encompass a large fraction of the unweighted graph. We present a new informed search algorithm, Iterative Monotonically Bounded A* (IMBA*), which first proves that no optimal paths exist in a bounded cut of the graph before considering larger cuts. We prove that IMBA* has the same optimality and completeness guarantees as A* and, in a non-uniform pathfinding application, we empirically demonstrate substantial speed improvements over classic A*.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3778/3837,
2,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",On the Complexity of BDDs for State Space Search: A Case Study in Connect Four,"Stefan Edelkamp, Peter Kissmann","Symbolic search using BDDs usually saves huge amounts of memory, while in some domains its savings are moderate at best. It is an open problem to determine if BDDs work well for a certain domain. Motivated by finding evidences for BDD growths for state space search, in this paper we are concerned with symbolic search in the domain of Connect Four. We prove that there is a variable ordering for which the set of all possible states – when continuing after a terminal state has been reached – can be represented by polynomial sized BDDs, whereas the termination criterion leads to an exponential number of nodes in the BDD given any variable ordering.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3690/3827,
3,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",The Compressed Differential Heuristic,"Meir Goldenberg, Nathan Sturtevant, Ariel Felner, Jonathan Schaeffer","The differential heuristic (DH) is an effective memory-based heuristic for explicit state spaces. In this paper we aim to improve its performance and memory usage. We introduce a compression method for DHs which stores only a portion of the original uncompressed DH, while preserving enough information to enable efficient search.  Compressed DHs (CDH) are flexible and can be tuned to fit any size of memory, even smaller than the size of the state space. Furthermore, CDHs can be built without the need to create and store the entire uncompressed DH. Experimental results across different domains show that, for a given amount of memory, a CDH  significantly outperforms an uncompressed DH.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3723/3829,
4,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Heuristic Search for Large Problems With Real Costs,"Matthew Hatem, Ethan Burns, Wheeler Ruml","The memory requirements of basic best-first heuristic search algorithms like A* make them infeasible for solving large problems. External disk storage is cheap and plentiful com- pared to the cost of internal RAM. Unfortunately, state-of- the-art external memory search algorithms either rely on brute-force search techniques, such as breadth-first search, or they rely on all node values falling in a narrow range of in- tegers, and thus perform poorly on real-world domains with real-valued costs. We present a new general-purpose algo- rithm, PEDAL, that uses external memory and parallelism to perform a best-first heuristic search capable of solving large problems with real costs. We show theoretically that PEDAL is I/O efficient and empirically that it is both better on a stan- dard unit-cost benchmark, surpassing internal IDA* on the 15-puzzle, and gives far superior performance on problems with real costs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3758/3836,
5,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Core-Guided Binary Search Algorithms for Maximum Satisfiability,"Federico Heras, Antonio Morgado, Joao Marques-Silva","Several MaxSAT algorithms based on iterative SAT solving have been proposed in recent years. These algorithms are in general the most efﬁcient for real-world applications. Existing data indicates that, among MaxSAT algorithms based on iterative SAT solving, the most efﬁcient ones are core-guided, i.e. algorithms which guide the search by iteratively computing unsatisﬁable subformulas (or cores). For weighted MaxSAT, core-guided algorithms exhibit a number of important drawbacks, including a possibly exponential number of iterations and the use of a large number of auxiliary variables. This paper develops two new algorithms for (weighted) MaxSAT that address these two drawbacks. The ﬁrst MaxSAT algorithm implements core-guided iterative SAT solving with binary search. The second algorithm extends the ﬁrst one by exploiting disjoint cores. The empirical evaluation shows that core-guided binary search is competitive with current MaxSAT solvers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3713/3828,
6,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Optimal Packing of High-Precision Rectangles,"Eric Huang, Richard E. Korf","The rectangle-packing problem consists of ﬁnding an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can contain a given set of rectangles without overlap. Our new benchmark includes rectangles of successively higher precision, challenging the previous state-of-the-art, which enumerates all locations for placing rectangles, as well as all bounding box widths and heights up to the optimal box. We instead limit the rectangles’ coordinates and bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of the rectangles’ dimensions. We also dynamically prune values by learning from infeasible subtrees and constrain the problem by replacing rectangles and empty space with larger rectangles. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, we test 4,500 times fewer bounding boxes on the high-precision benchmark and solve N =9 over two orders of magnitude faster. We also present all optimal solutions up to N =15, which requires 39 bits of precision to solve. Finally, on the open problem of whether or not one can pack a particular inﬁnite series of rectangles into the unit square, we pack the ﬁrst 50,000 such rectangles witha greedy heuristic and conjecture that the entire inﬁnite series can ﬁt..",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3581/3820,

This framework can handle more general constraints as well as different domain representations, such as interval domains which are commonly used for bounds consistency in constraint programming (CP), and even set variables. Our empirical evaluation shows that our solver, built upon this framework, works robustly across a number of challenging domains.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3728/3831,

We propose and implement the Iterative Greedy Variable Ordering (IGVO) algorithm, a new variant within this algorithm class. An empirical evaluation using different ranking functions and conditions of randomness, demonstrates that IGVO finds significantly better orderings than standard greedy ordering implementations when evaluated within an anytime framework. Additional order of magnitude improvements are demonstrated on a multi-core system, thus further expanding the set of solvable graphical models. The experiments also confirm the superiority of the MinFill heuristic within the iterative scheme.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3771/3835,
9,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",A Comparison of Lex Bounds for Multiset Variables in Constraint Programming,"Yat Chiu Law, Jimmy Ho Man Lee, May Hiu Chun Woo, Toby Walsh","Set and multiset variables in constraint programming have typically been represented using subset bounds. However, this is a weak representation that neglects potentially useful information about a set such as its cardinality.  For set variables, the length-lex (LL)  representation successfully provides information about the length (cardinality) and position in the lexicographic ordering.  For multiset variables, where elements can be repeated, we consider richer representations that take into account additional information. We study eight different representations in which we maintain bounds according to one of the eight different orderings: length-(co)lex (LL/LC), variety-(co)lex (VL/VC), length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC), and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) orderings.  These representations integrate together information about the cardinality, variety (number of distinct elements in the multiset), and position in some total ordering.  Theoretical and empirical comparisons of expressiveness and compactness of the eight representations suggest that length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC) and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) usually give tighter bounds after constraint propagation.  We implement the eight representations and evaluate them against the subset bounds representation with cardinality and variety reasoning.  Results demonstrate that they offer significantly better pruning and runtime.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3796/3838,
10,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Distributed Constraint Optimization Under Stochastic Uncertainty,"Thomas Léauté, Boi Faltings","In many real-life optimization problems involving multiple agents, the rewards are not necessarily known exactly in advance, but rather depend on sources of exogenous uncertainty. For instance, delivery companies might have to coordinate to choose who should serve which foreseen customer, under uncertainty in the locations of the customers. The framework of Distributed Constraint Optimization under Stochastic Uncertainty was proposed to model such problems; in this paper, we generalize this formalism by introducing the concept of evaluation functions that model various optimization criteria. We take the example of three such evaluation functions, expectation, consensus, and robustness, and we adapt and generalize two previous algorithms accordingly. Our experimental results on a class of Vehicle Routing Problems show that incomplete algorithms are not only cheaper than complete ones (in terms of simulated time, Non-Concurrent Constraint Checks, and information exchange), but they are also often able to find the optimal solution. We also show that exchanging more information about the dependencies of their respective cost functions on the sources of uncertainty can help the agents discover higher-quality solutions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3430/3818,
11,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Planning in Domains with Cost Function Dependent Actions,"Mike Phillips, Maxim Likhachev","In a number of graph search-based planning problems, the value of the cost function that is being minimized also affects the set of possible actions at some or all the states in the graph. For example, in path planning for a robot with a limited battery power, a common cost function is energy consumption, whereas the level of remaining energy affects the navigational capabilities of the robot. Similarly, in path planning for a robot navigating dynamic environments, a total traversal time is a common cost function whereas the timestep affects whether a particular transition is valid. In such planning problems, the cost function typically becomes one of the state variables thereby increasing the dimensionality of the planning problem, and consequently the size of the graph that represents the problem.  In this paper, we show how to avoid this increase in the dimensionality for the planning problems whenever the availability of the actions is monotonically non-increasing with the increase in the cost function. We present three variants of A* search for dealing with such planning problems: a provably optimal version, a suboptimal version that scales to larger problems while maintaining a bound on suboptimality, and finally a version that relaxes our assumption on the relationship between the cost function and action space. Our experimental analysis on several domains shows that the presented algorithms achieve up to several orders of magnitude speed up over the alternative approaches to planning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3766/3833,
12,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Euclidean Heuristic Optimization,"D. Chris F. Rayner, Michael H. Bowling, Nathan R. Sturtevant","We pose the problem of constructing good search heuristics as an optimization problem: minimizing the loss between the true distances and the heuristic estimates subject to admissibility and consistency constraints. For a well-motivated choice of loss function, we show performing this optimization is tractable.  In fact, it corresponds to a recently proposed method for dimensionality reduction. We prove this optimization is guaranteed to produce admissible and consistent heuristics, generalizes and gives insight into differential heuristics, and show experimentally that it produces strong heuristics on problems from three distinct search domains.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3594/3821,

For use in state-space search, we give algorithms for member testing and element hashing with runtime dependent only on state- size, as well as space and memory efficient construction of and iteration over such sets. Finally we compare LOES to binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and explicitly packed set- representation over a range of IPC planning problems. Our results show LOES produces succinct set-encodings for a wider range of planning problems than both BDDs and ex- plicit state representation, increasing the number of problems that can be solved cost-optimally.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3656/3825,

We consider problems from Constraint Satisfaction, Global Constraints, Satisfiability, Nonmonotonic and Bayesian Reasoning.  We show that, subject to a complexity theoretic assumption, none of the considered problems can be reduced by polynomial-time preprocessing to a problem kernel whose size is polynomial in a structural problem parameter of the input, such as induced width or backdoor size. Our results provide a firm theoretical boundary for the performance of polynomial-time preprocessing algorithms for the considered problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3629/3823,
15,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Inner Regions and Interval Linearizations for Global Optimization,"Gilles Trombettoni, Ignacio Araya, Bertrand Neveu, Gilles Chabert","Researchers from interval analysis and constraint (logic) programming communities have studied intervals for their ability to manage infinite solution sets of numerical constraint systems. In particular, inner regions represent subsets of the search space in which all points are solutions. Our main contribution is the use of recent and new inner region extraction algorithms in the upper bounding phase of constrained global optimization. Convexification is a major key for efficiently lower bounding the objective function. We have adapted the convex interval taylorization proposed by Lin and Stadherr for producing a reliable outer and inner polyhedral approximation of the solution set and  alinearization of the objective function. Other original ingredients are part of our optimizer, including an efficient interval constraint propagation algorithm exploiting monotonicity of functions. We end up with a new framework for reliable continuous constrained global optimization. Our interval  B&B is implemented in the interval-based explorer Ibex and extends this free C++ library. Our strategy outperforms the best reliable global optimizers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3649/3824,
16,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Anytime Nonparametric A*,"Jur van den Berg, Rajat Shah, Arthur Huang, Ken Goldberg","Anytime variants of Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms quickly produce a suboptimal solution and then improve it over time. For example, ARA* introduces a weighting value ""epsilon"" to rapidly find an initial suboptimal path and then reduces ""epsilon"" to improve path quality over time. In ARA*, ""epsilon"" is based on a linear trajectory with ad-hoc parameters chosen by each user. We propose a new Anytime A* algorithm, Anytime Nonparametric A* (ANA*), that does not require ad-hoc parameters, and adaptively reduces varepsilon to expand the most promising node per iteration, adapting the greediness of the search as path quality improves. We prove that each node expanded by ANA* provides an upper bound on the suboptimality of the current-best solution. We evaluate the performance of ANA* with experiments in the domains of robot motion planning, gridworld planning, and multiple sequence alignment. The results suggest that ANA* is as efficient as ARA* and in most cases: (1) ANA* finds an initial solution faster, (2) ANA* spends less time between solution improvements, (3) ANA* decreases the suboptimality bound of the current-best solution more gradually, and (4) ANA* finds the optimal solution faster. ANA* is freely available from Maxim Likhachev's Search-based Planning Library (SBPL).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3680/3826,
17,2011,"Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search",Solving Difficult CSPs with Relational Neighborhood Inverse Consistency,"Robert J. Woodward, Shant Karakashian, Berthe Y. Choueiry, Christian Bessiere","Freuder and Elfe (1996) introduced Neighborhood Inverse Consistency (NIC) as a strong local consistency property for binary CSPs.  While enforcing NIC can significantly filter the variables domains, the proposed algorithm is too costly to be used on dense graphs or for lookahead during search.  In this paper, we introduce and characterize Relational Neighborhood Inverse Consistency (RNIC) as a local consistency property that operates on the dual graph of a non-binary CSP.  We describe and characterize a practical algorithm for enforcing it.  We argue that defining RNIC on the dual graph unveils unsuspected opportunities to reduce the computational cost of our algorithm and increase its filtering effectiveness.  We show how to achieve those effects by modifying the topology of the dual graph, yielding new variations the RNIC property. We also introduce an adaptive strategy to automatically select the appropriate property to enforce given the connectivity of the dual graph.  We integrate the resulting techniques as full lookahead strategies in a backtrack search procedure for solving CSPs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for solving known difficult benchmark problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3737/3832,

First, we introduce a new type of database, the Local Distance Database (LDDB), that contains distances between boundary points of a local neighborhood. Second, an LDDB based algorithm is introduced, called Block A*, that calculates the optimal path between start and goal locations given the local distances stored in the LDDB. Third, our experimental results for any-angle path planning in a wide variety of test domains, including real game maps, show that Block A* is faster than both A* and the previously best grid-based any-angle search algorithm, Theta*.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3449/3819,
19,2011,Knowledge-Based Information Systems,Simulated Annealing Based Influence Maximization in Social Networks,"Qingye Jiang, Guojie Song, Cong Gao, Yu Wang, Wenjun Si, Kunqing Xie","The problem of influence maximization, i.e., mining top-k influential nodes from a social network such that the spread of influence in the network is maximized, is NP-hard. Most of the existing algorithms for the prob- lem are based on greedy algorithm. Although greedy algorithm can achieve a good approximation, it is computational expensive. In this paper, we propose a totally different approach based on Simulated Annealing(SA) for the influence maximization problem. This is the first SA based algorithm for the problem. Additionally, we propose two heuristic methods to accelerate the con- vergence process of SA, and a new method of comput- ing influence to speed up the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on four real networks show that the proposed algorithms run faster than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm by 2-3 orders of magnitude while being able to improve the accuracy of greedy algorithm.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3670/3841,

So the preference varying speeds for users are different. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic nonlinear matrix factorization model for collaborative filtering, aimed to improve the rating prediction performance as well as track the preference varying speeds for different users. We assume that user-preference changes smoothly over time, and the preference varying speeds for users are different. These two assumptions are incorporated into the proposed model as prior knowledge on user feature vectors, which can be learned efficiently by MAP estimation. The experimental results show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in the rating prediction task, but also provides an effective way to track user-preference varying speed.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3582/3839,
21,2011,Knowledge-Based Information Systems,CosTriage: A Cost-Aware Triage Algorithm for Bug Reporting Systems,"Jin-woo Park, Mu-Woong Lee, Jinhan Kim, Seung-won Hwang, Sunghun Kim","""Who can fix this bug?"" is an important question in bug triage to ""accurately"" assign developers to bug reports. To address this question, recent research treats it as a optimizing recommendation accuracy problem and proposes a solution that is essentially an instance of content-based recommendation (CBR). However, CBR is well-known to cause over-specialization, recommending only the types of bugs that each developer has solved before. This problem is critical in practice, as some experienced developers could be overloaded, and this would slow the bug fixing process. In this paper, we take two directions to address this problem: First,we reformulate the problem as an optimization problem of both accuracy and cost. Second, we adopt a content-boosted collaborative filtering (CBCF), combining an existing CBR with a collaborative filtering recommender (CF), which enhances the recommendationquality of either approach alone. However, unlike general recommendation scenarios, bug fix history is extremely sparse. Due to the nature of bug fixes, one bug is fixed by only one developer, which makes it challenging to pursue the above two directions. To address this challenge, we develop a topic-model to reduce the sparseness and enhance the quality of CBCF. Our experimental evaluation shows that our solution reduces the cost efficiently by 30% without seriously compromising accuracy.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3705/3842,
22,2011,Knowledge-Based Information Systems,Relational Blocking for Causal Discovery,"Matthew Rattigan, Marc Maier, David Jensen","Blocking is a technique commonly used in manual statistical analysis to account for confounding variables.  However, blocking is not currently used in automated learning algorithms.  These algorithms rely solely on statistical conditioning as an operator to identify conditional independence.  In this work, we present relational blocking as a new operator that can be used for learning the structure of causal models.  We describe how blocking is enabled by relational data sets, where blocks are determined by the links in the network. By blocking on entities rather than conditioning on variables, relational blocking can account for both measured and unobserved variables. We explain the mechanism of these methods using graphical models and the semantics of d-separation.  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of relational blocking for use in causal discovery by showing how blocking can be used in the causal analysis of two real-world social media systems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3760/3843,

Yet, most machine-readable sources of knowledge either lack such common sense facts entirely or have only limited coverage. Prior work on automated knowledge base construction has largely focused on relations between named entities and on taxonomic knowledge, while disregarding common sense properties. In this paper, we show how to gather large amounts of common sense facts from Web n-gram data, using seeds from the ConceptNet collection. Our novel contributions include scalable methods for tapping onto Web-scale data and a new scoring model to determine which patterns and facts are most reliable.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to the social recommendation problem, which takes the advantage of the graph Laplacian regularization to capture the underlying social relationship among the users. Differently from the previous approaches, that are based on the conventional gradient descent optimization, we formulate the presented graph Laplacian regularized social recommendation problem into a low-rank semidefinite program, which is able to be efficiently solved by the quasi-Newton algorithm. We have conducted the empirical evaluation on a large scale dataset of high sparsity, the promising experimental results show that our method is very effective and efficient for the social recommendation task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3596/3840,
25,2011,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,A Semantical Account of Progression in the Presence of Uncertainty,"Vaishak Belle, Gerhard Lakemeyer","Building on a general theory of action by Reiter and his colleagues, Bacchus et al.  give an account for formalizing degrees of belief and noisy actions in the situation calculus. Unfortunately, there is no clear solution to the projection problem for the formalism. And, while the model has epistemic features, it is not obvious what the agent's knowledge base should look like. Also, reasoning about uncertainty essentially resorts to second-order logic. In recent work, Gabaldon and Lakemeyer remedy these shortcomings somewhat, but here too the utility seems to be restricted to queries (with action operators) about the initial theory. In this paper, we propose a fresh amalgamation of a modal fragment of the situation calculus and uncertainty, where the idea will be to update the initial knowledge base, containing both ordinary and (certain kinds of) probabilistic beliefs, when noisy actions are performed. We show that the new semantics has the right properties, and study a special case where updating probabilistic beliefs is computable. Our ideas are closely related to the Lin and Reiter notion of progression.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3715/3860,

The measure is based on the spatial overlap of the “shapes” and “densities” of these point sets. It is applicable in any domain where point sets are a natural representation for data. Specifically, we show examples of its use in natural language processing, object recognition in images and point set classification. We provide a geometric interpretation of this measure and show that it is well-motivated, intuitive, parameter-free, and straightforward to use.

Our study starts from the observation that the various possibilities of adding higher-order con- structs to a DL form a spectrum of increasing expres- sive power, including domain metamodeling, i.e., using concepts and roles as predicate arguments. We argue that higher-order features of this type are sufficiently rich and powerful for the modeling requirements aris- ing in many relevant situations, and therefore we carry out an investigation of the computational complexity of satisfiability and conjunctive query answering in DLs extended with such higher-order features. In particular, we show that adding domain metamodeling capabilities to SHIQ (the core of OWL 2) has no impact on the complexity of the various reasoning tasks. This is also true for DL-LiteR (the core of OWL 2 QL) under suit- able restrictions on the queries.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3704/3861,

Sequoia handles multiple faults, that can be intermittent, at polynomial time and space complexity, due to a novel, approximate diagnostic entropy estimation approach, which considers the subset of diagnoses that cover almost all Bayesian posterior probability mass. Synthetic experiments show that Sequoia achieves much better diagnostic uncertainty reduction compared to random test sequencing.Real programs, taken from the Software Infrastructure Repository, confirm Sequoia's better performance, with a test reduction up to 80% compared to random test sequences.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3565/3847,

For the case where probabilities apply only to concepts, we provide a careful analysis of the borderline between tractability and ExpTime-completeness. One outcome is that any probability value except zero and one leads to intractability in the presence of general TBoxes, while this is not the case for classical TBoxes. For the case where probabilities can also be applied to roles, we show PSpace-completeness.

A typical example of this task is travel-time prediction on road networks. The main technical challenge here is to infer the costs of trajectories including links with no or little passage history. To tackle this, we introduce a weight propagation mechanism over the links, and show that the problem can be reduced to a simple form of kernel ridge regression. We also show that this new formulation leads us to a unifying view, where a natural choice of the kernel is suggested to an existing kernel-based alternative.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3695/3858,
32,2011,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,An Algebraic Prolog for Reasoning about Possible Worlds,"Angelika Kimmig, Guy Van den Broeck, Luc De Raedt","We introduce aProbLog, a generalization of the probabilistic logic programming language ProbLog. An aProbLog program consists of a set of definite clauses and a set of algebraic facts; each such fact is labeled with an element of a semiring. A wide variety of labels is possible, ranging from probability values to reals (representing costs or utilities), polynomials, Boolean functions or data structures. The semiring is then used to calculate labels of possible worlds and of queries. We formally define the semantics of aProbLog and study the aProbLog inference problem, which is concerned with computing the label of a query. Two conditions are introduced that allow one to simplify the inference problem, resulting in four different algorithms and settings. Representative basic problems for each of these four settings are: is there a possible world where a query is true (SAT), how many such possible worlds are there (#SAT), what is the probability of a query being true (PROB), and what is the most likely world where the query is true (MPE). We further illustrate these settings with a number of tasks requiring more complex semirings.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3685/3854,
33,2011,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,Two-Dimensional Description Logics for Context-Based Semantic Interoperability,"Szymon Klarman, Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto","Description Logics (DLs) provide a clear and broadly accepted paradigm for modeling and reasoning about terminological knowledge. However, it has been often noted, that although DLs are well-suited for representing a single, global viewpoint on an application domain, they offer no formal grounding for dealing with knowledge pertaining to multiple heterogeneous viewpoints — a scenario ever more often approached in practical applications, e.g. concerned with reasoning over distributed knowledge sources on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we study a natural extension of DLs, in the style of two-dimensional modal logics, which supports declarative modeling of viewpoints as contexts, in the sense of McCarthy, and their semantic interoperability. The formalism is based on two-dimensional semantics, where one dimension represents a usual object domain and the other a (possibly infinite) domain of viewpoints, addressed by additional modal operators and a metalanguage, on the syntactic level. We systematically introduce a number of expressive fragments of the proposed logic, study their computational complexity and connections to related formalisms.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3688/3856,

Its main application is ontology-based data access, where ontologies are used to provide background knowledge for answering queries over data. We investigate the corresponding notion of query inseparability (or equivalence) for OWL 2 QL ontologies and show that deciding query inseparability is PSPACE-hard and in EXPTIME. We give polynomial time (incomplete) algorithms and demonstrate by experiments that they can be used for practical module extraction.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3573/3849,

In particular, we exemplify the applicability of the method by establishing the consistency of the foundational ontology DOLCE, a large, first-order ontology. The approach we advocate constructs a global model for a theory, in our case DOLCE, built from smaller models of subtheories together with amalgamability properties between such models. The proof proceeds by (i) hand-crafting a so-called architectural specification of DOLCE which reflects the way models of the theory can be built, (ii) an automated verification of the amalgamability conditions, and (iii) a (partially automated) series of relative consistency proofs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3754/3863,

These different approaches in general agree on rules without cycles. However, they differ on causal rules with mutual cyclic dependencies, both in terms of how these rules are supposed to be represented and their semantics. In this paper we show that by adding one more minimization to Lin's circumscriptive causal theory in the situation calculus, we can have a uniform representation of causal rules including those with cyclic dependencies. We also demonstrate that sometimes causal rules can be compiled into logically equivalent successor state axioms even in the presence of cyclical dependencies between fluents.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3674/3855,

We argue that unintended effects occur when imposing the traditionally employed semantics on the very expressive DLs that underly the OWL 1 and OWL 2 standards. Consequently, we suggest a revised semantics that behaves more intuitively in these cases and coincides with the traditional semantics of less expressive DLs. Moreover, we introduce a way of answering epistemic queries to OWL knowledge bases by a reduction to standard OWL reasoning.

We introduce a formal representation called ""selection diagrams"" for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between environments  and, using this representation, we derive procedures for deciding whether effects in the target environment can be inferred from experiments conducted elsewhere. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify the set of experiments and observations that need be conducted to license the transport.

39,2011,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,How to Calibrate the Scores of Biased Reviewers by Quadratic Programming,"Magnus Roos, Jörg Rothe, Björn Scheuermann","Peer reviewing is the key ingredient of evaluating the quality of scientific work. Based on the review scores assigned by the individual reviewers to the submissions, program committees of conferences and journal editors decide which papers to accept for publication and which to reject. However, some reviewers may be more rigorous than others, they may be biased one way or the other, and they often have highly subjective preferences over the papers they review. Moreover, each reviewer usually has only a very local view, as he or she evaluates only a small fraction of the submissions. Despite all these shortcomings, the review scores obtained need to be aggregrated in order to globally rank all submissions and to make the acceptance/rejection decision. A common method is to simply take the average of each submission's review scores, possibly weighted by the reviewers' confidence levels. Unfortunately, the global ranking thus produced often suffers a certain unfairness, as the reviewers' biases and limitations are not taken into account. We propose a method for calibrating the scores of reviewers that are potentially biased and blindfolded by having only partial information. Our method uses a maximum likelihood estimator, which estimates both the bias of each individual reviewer and the unknown ""ideal"" score of each submission. This yields a quadratic program whose solution transforms the individual review scores into calibrated, globally comparable scores. We argue why our method results in a fairer and more reasonable global ranking than simply taking the average of scores. To show its usefulness, we test our method empirically using real-world data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3578/3850,

McIlraith",In this paper we examine the general problem of generating preferred explanations for observed behavior with respect to a model of the behavior of a dynamical system. This problem arises in a diversity of applications including diagnosis of dynamical systems and activity recognition. We provide a logical characterization of the notion of an explanation. To generate explanations we identify and exploit a correspondence between explanation generation and planning. The determination of good explanations requires additional domain-specific knowledge which we represent as preferences over explanations. The nature of explanations requires us to formulate preferences in a somewhat retrodictive fashion by utilizing Past Linear Temporal Logic. We propose methods for exploiting these somewhat unique preferences effectively within state-of-the-art planners and illustrate the feasibility of generating (preferred) explanations via planning.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3568/3848,

By reformulating Parikh's relevance criterion in the setting of Horn belief change, we construct a relevance-based partial meet Horn contraction operator and provide a representation theorem for the operator. Interestingly, we find that this contraction operator can be fully characterised by Delgrande and Wassermann's postulates for partial meet Horn contraction as well as Parikh's relevance postulate without requiring any change on the postulates, which is qualitatively different from the case in classical propositional logic.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3686/3857,

We show that both Rosati's semantics based on NM-models and Lukasiewicz's answer set semantics can be characterized by circumscription, and the difference between the two can be seen as a matter of circumscription policies. This approach leads to a number of new insights. First, we rebut a criticism on Lukasiewicz's semantics for its inability to reason for negative consequences. Second, our approach leads to a spectrum of possible semantics based on different circumscription policies, and shows a clear picture of how they are related.

To address this issue, we propose a notion called $k$-forgetting, also called bounded forgetting in general, for any fixed number $k$. We present several equivalent characterizations of bounded forgetting and show that the result of bounded forgetting, on one hand, can always be captured by a single first-order sentence, and on the other hand, preserves the information that we are concerned with.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3481/3846,

45,2011,Machine Learning,An Online Spectral Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Nonlinear Dynamical Systems,"Byron Boots, Geoffrey J. Gordon","Recently, a number of researchers have proposed spectral algorithms for learning models of dynamical systems — for example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and Transformed Predictive State Representations (TPSRs). These algorithms are attractive since they are statistically consistent and not subject to local optima. However, they are batch methods: they need to store their entire training data set in memory at once and operate on it as a large matrix, and so they cannot scale to extremely large data sets (either many examples or many features per example). In turn, this restriction limits their ability to learn accurate models of complex systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new online spectral algorithm, which uses tricks such as incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and random projections to scale to much larger data sets and more complex systems than previous methods. We demonstrate the new method on an inertial measurement prediction task and a high-bandwidth video mapping task and we illustrate desirable behaviors such as ""closing the loop,"" where the latent state representation changes suddenly as the learner recognizes that it has returned to a previously known place.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3703/3908,

However, each of them is based on a different rigorous symbolic framework which makes it hard to use their data in other systems. It is unfortunate because such rich structured knowledge might lead to a huge leap forward in many other areas of AI like nat- ural language processing (word-sense disambiguation, natural language understanding, ...), vision (scene classification, image semantic annotation, ...) or collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present a learning process based on an innovative neural network architecture designed to embed any of these symbolic representations into a more flexible continuous vector space in which the original knowledge is kept and enhanced. These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily used in recent machine learning meth- ods for prediction and information retrieval.

A natural question is whether it is possible to reconstruct category taxonomies in cases where we are not given explicit information about how categories are related to each other, but only a sample of observations of the members of each category. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian model of multi-level category learning, an extension of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that we call the tree-HDP. We demonstrate the ability of the tree-HDP to reconstruct simulated datasets of artificial taxonomies, and show that it produces similar performance to human learners on a taxonomy inference task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3427/3874,
48,2011,Machine Learning,Large Scale Spectral Clustering with Landmark-Based Representation,"Xinlei Chen, Deng Cai","Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering approaches. Despite its good performance, it is limited in its applicability to large-scale problems due to its high computational complexity. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to accelerate the spectral clustering. Unfortunately, these methods usually sacrifice quite a lot information of the original data, thus result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Landmark-based Spectral Clustering (LSC), for large scale clustering problems. Specifically, we select $p\ (\ll n)$ representative data points as the landmarks and represent the original data points as the linear combinations of these landmarks. The spectral embedding of the data can then be efficiently computed with the landmark-based representation. The proposed algorithm scales linearly with the problem size.

The majority of existing behaviour recognition systems are based on supervised learning algorithms, which means that training them requires a preprocessed, annotated dataset. Unfortunately, annotating a dataset is a rather tedious process and one that is prone to error. In this paper we suggest a way to identify structure in the data based on text compression and the edit distance between words, without any prior labelling. We demonstrate that by using this method we can automatically identify patterns and segment the data into patterns that correspond to human behaviours. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we use a dataset from a smart home and compare the labels produced by our approach with the labels assigned by a human to the activities in the dataset. We find that the results are promising and show significant improvement in the recognition accuracy over Self-Organising Maps (SOMs).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3618/3892,

We build on the work of Mahadevan and his colleagues, who pioneered the use of spectral clustering methods for basis function construction. Their methods work on top of a graph that captures state adjacency. Instead, we use bisimulation metrics in order to provide state distances for spectral clustering. The advantage of these metrics is that they incorporate reward information in a natural way, in addition to the state transition information. We provide theoretical bounds on the quality of the obtained approximation, which justify the importance of incorporating reward information. We also demonstrate empirically that the approximation quality improves when bisimulation metrics are used instead of the state adjacency graph in the basis function construction process.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3663/3901,

Previous research often focus on social influence analysis in network-level or topic-level. In this paper, we concentrate on predicting item-level social influence to reveal the users' influences in a more fine-grained level. We formulate the social influence prediction problem as the estimation of a user-post matrix, where each entry in the matrix represents the social influence strength the corresponding user has given the corresponding web post. To deal with the sparsity and complex factor challenges in the research, we model the problem by extending the probabilistic matrix factorization method to incorporate rich prior knowledge on both user dimension and web post dimension, and propose the Probabilistic Hybrid Factor Matrix Factorization (PHF-MF) approach.

52,2011,Machine Learning,Selective Transfer Between Learning Tasks Using Task-Based Boosting,"Eric Eaton, Marie desJardins","The success of transfer learning on a target task is highly dependent on the selected source data. Instance transfer methods reuse data from the source tasks to augment the training data for the target task. If poorly chosen, this source data may inhibit learning, resulting in negative transfer. The current most widely used algorithm for instance transfer, TrAdaBoost, performs poorly when given irrelevant source data. We present a novel task-based boosting technique for instance transfer that selectively chooses the source knowledge to transfer to the target task.  Our approach performs boosting at both the instance level and the task level, assigning higher weight to those source tasks that show positive transferability to the target task, and adjusting the weights of individual instances within each source task via AdaBoost.  We show that this combination of task- and instance-level boosting significantly improves transfer performance over existing instance transfer algorithms when given a mix of relevant and irrelevant source data, especially for small amounts of data on the target task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3752/3915,

Some work has been done to extend ensemble techniques for classification in relational domains by taking relational data characteristics or multiple link types into account during model construction. However, since these approaches follow the conventional approach to ensemble learning, they improve performance by reducing the error due to variance in learning. We note however, that variance in inference can be an additional source of error in relational methods that use collective classification, since inferred values are propagated during inference. We propose a novel ensemble mechanism for collective classification that reduces  both learning and inference variance, by incorporating prediction averaging into the collective inference process itself.

More importantly, we clearly show that pairwise constraint propagation is actually equivalent to solving a Lyapunov matrix equation, which is widely used in Control Theory as a standard continuous-time equation. Different from most previous constraint propagation methods that suffer from severe limitations, our method can directly be applied to multi-class problem and also can effectively exploit both must-link and cannot-link constraints. The propagated constraints are further used to adjust the similarity between data points so that they can be incorporated into subsequent clustering. The proposed method has been tested in clustering tasks on six real-life data sets and then shown to achieve significant improvements with respect to the state of the arts.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3458/3879,

In this paper, we propose to learn a kernel for multi-task clustering. Our goal is to learn a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the geometric structure of the data in each task is preserved, while the data distributions of any two tasks are as close as possible. This is formulated as a unified kernel learning framework, under which we study two types of kernel learning: nonparametric kernel learning and spectral kernel design. Both types of kernel learning can be solved by linear programming. Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that kernel k-means on the learned kernel can achieve better clustering results than traditional single-task clustering methods.

We investigate novel loss functions for multilabel training within a large margin framework---identifying a simple alternative that yields improved generalization while still allowing efficient training.

In this paper, we try to reduce the chance of performance degeneration of S3VMs. Our basic idea is that, rather than exploiting all unlabeled data, the unlabeled instances should be selected such that only the ones which are very likely to be helpful are exploited, while some highly risky unlabeled instances are avoided. We propose the S3VM-us method by using hierarchical clustering to select the unlabeled instances.

By optimizing the order information of the observations and preserving the intrinsic geometry of the data set simultaneously, the proposed algorithm provides the faithful ordinal regression to the new coming data points.

63,2011,Machine Learning,Mean Field Inference in Dependency Networks: An Empirical Study,"Daniel Lowd, Arash Shamaei","Dependency networks are a compelling alternative to Bayesian networks for learning joint probability distributions from data and using them to compute probabilities.  A dependency network consists of a set of conditional probability distributions, each representing the probability of a single variable given its Markov blanket.  Running Gibbs sampling with these conditional distributions produces a joint distribution that can be used to answer queries, but suffers from the traditional slowness of sampling-based inference.  In this paper, we observe that the mean field update equation can be applied to dependency networks, even though the conditional probability distributions may be inconsistent with each other.  In experiments with learning and inference on 12 datasets, we demonstrate that mean field inference in dependency networks offers similar accuracy to Gibbs sampling but with orders of magnitude improvements in speed.  Compared to Bayesian networks learned on the same data, dependency networks offer higher accuracy at greater amounts of evidence.  Furthermore, mean field inference is consistently more accurate in dependency networks than in Bayesian networks learned on the same data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3790/3919,
64,2011,Machine Learning,Latent Semantic Learning by Efficient Sparse Coding with Hypergraph Regularization,"Zhiwu Lu, Yuxin Peng","This paper presents a novel latent semantic learning algorithm for action recognition. Through efficient sparse coding, we can learn latent semantics (i.e. high-level features) from a large vocabulary of abundant mid-level features (i.e. visual keywords). More importantly, we can capture the manifold structure hidden among mid-level features by incorporating hypergraph regularization into sparse coding. The learnt latent semantics can further be readily used for action recognition by defining a histogram intersection kernel. Different from the traditional latent semantic analysis based on topic models, our sparse coding method with hypergraph regularization can exploit the manifold structure hidden among mid-level features for latent semantic learning, which results in compact but discriminative high-level features for action recognition. We have tested our method on the commonly used KTH action dataset and the unconstrained YouTube action dataset. The experimental results show the superior performance of our method.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3457/3877,

We will (1) emphasize that standard LDA solutions are not unique, (2) propose several new LDA formulations: St-orthonormal LDA, Sw-orthonormal LDA and orthogonal LDA which have unique solutions, and (3) show that with St-orthonormal LDA and Sw-orthonormal LDA formulations, solutions to all four major LDA objective functions are identical. Furthermore, we perform an indepth analysis to show that the LDA sometimes performs poorly due to over-fitting, i.e., it picks up PCA dimensions with small eigenvalues. From this analysis, we propose a stable LDA which uses PCA first to reduce to a small PCA subspace and do LDA in the subspace.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3712/3910,

We propose new multi-level clustering based low-rank matrix approximations which are comparable and even more compact than Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We utilize the cluster indicators of data clustering results to form the subspaces, hence our decomposition results are more interpretable. We further generalize our clustering based matrix decompositions to tensor decompositions that are useful in high-order data analysis. We also provide an upper bound for the approximation error of our tensor decomposition algorithm.

67,2011,Machine Learning,Sparse Group Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"Heng Luo, Ruimin Shen, Changyong Niu, Carsten Ullrich","Since learning in Boltzmann machines is typically quite slow, there is a need to restrict connections within hidden layers. However, theresulting states of hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies. Based on this observation, we propose using l1/l2 regularization upon the activation probabilities of hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the local dependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden units of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden units within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus, the l1/l2 regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the hidden unit levels. We call RBMs trained with the regularizer sparse group RBMs (SGRBMs). The proposed SGRBMs are appliedto model patches of natural images, handwritten digits and OCR English letters. Then to emphasize that SGRBMs can learn more discriminative features we applied SGRBMs to pretrain deep networks for classification tasks. Furthermore, we illustrate the regularizer can also be applied to deep Boltzmann machines, which lead to sparse group deep Boltzmann machines. When adapted to the MNIST data set, a two-layer sparse group Boltzmann machine achieves an error rate of 0.84%, which is, to our knowledge, the best published result on the permutation-invariant version of the MNIST task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3684/3905,

In practice, these algorithms do not scale well as the number of states grows because the algorithms spend too much effort exploring. We introduce an RL algorithm State TArgeted R-MAX (STAR-MAX) that explores a subset of the state space, called the exploration envelope ξ. When ξ equals the total state space, STAR-MAX behaves identically to R-MAX. When ξ is a subset of the state space, to keep exploration within ξ, a recovery rule β is needed. We compared existing algorithms with our algorithm employing various exploration envelopes. With an appropriate choice of ξ, STAR-MAX scales far better than existing RL algorithms as the number of states increases. A possible drawback of our algorithm is its dependence on a good choice of ξ and β. However, we show that an effective recovery rule β can be learned on-line and ξ can be learned from demonstrations. We also find that even randomly sampled exploration envelopes can improve cumulative rewards compared to R-MAX. We expect these results to lead to more efficient methods for RL in large-scale problems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3722/3912,

Specifically, we use DEV in TD-Q(lambda) to more accurately learn the relative value of the actions, rather than their absolute value. We identify conditions that ensure convergence w.p.1 of TD-Q(lambda) with DEV and show that this algorithm can also be used to directly approximate the advantage function associated with a given policy, without the need to compute an auxiliary function - something that, to the extent of our knowledge, was not known possible.

We formulate this as a within-network relational learning problem using few labels only and describe an algorithm that ranks atoms using a score based on random walks with restart (RWR): the probability that a random surfer hits an atom starting from the query atoms. Specifically, we compute an initial ranking using personalized PageRank. Then, we find paths of atoms that are connected via their arguments, variablize the ground atoms in each path, in order to create features for the query. These features are used to re-personalize the original RWR and to finally compute the set completion, based on Label Propagation. Moreover, we exploit that RWR techniques can naturally be lifted and show that lifted inference for label propagation is possible. We evaluate our algorithm on a realworld relational dataset by finding completions of sets of objects describing the Roman city of Pompeii. We compare to Bayesian sets and show that our approach gives very reasonable set completions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3587/3887,

Our work is built upon the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) classification framework. Due to the semidefiniteness constraint in the optimization problem of LMNN, it is not scalable in terms of the dimensionality of the input data. The original LMNN solver partially alleviates this problem by adopting alternating projection methods instead of standard interior-point methods. Still, at each iteration, the computation complexity is at least O(D3) (D is the dimension of input data). In this work, we propose a column generation based algorithm to solve the LMNN optimization problem much more efficiently. Our algorithm is much more scalable in tha tat each iteration, it does not need full eigen-decomposition. Instead, we only need to find the leading eigen value and its corresponding eigen vector, which is of O(D2) complexity.

Choosing these features can be a difficult challenge in itself. One recent effort, Regularized Approximate Linear Programming (RALP), uses L1 regularization to address this issue by combining a large initial set of features with a regularization penalty that favors a smooth value function with few non-zero weights. Rather than using smoothness as a backhanded way of addressing the feature selection problem, this paper starts with smoothness and develops a non-parametric approach to ALP that is consistent with the smoothness assumption.

Lewis","Planning agents often lack the computational resources needed to build full planning trees for their environments. Agent designers commonly overcome this finite-horizon approximation by applying an evaluation function at the leaf-states of the planning tree. Recent work has proposed an alternative approach for overcoming computational constraints on agent design: modify the reward function. In this work, we compare this reward design approach to the common leaf-evaluation heuristic approach for improving planning agents. We show that in many agents, the reward design approach strictly subsumes the leaf-evaluation approach, i.e., there exists a reward function for every leaf-evaluation heuristic that leads to equivalent behavior, but the converse is not true. We demonstrate that this generality leads to improved performance when an agent makes approximations in addition to the finite-horizon approximation. As part of our contribution, we extend PGRD, an online reward design algorithm, to develop reward design algorithms for Sparse Sampling and UCT, two algorithms capable of planning in large state spaces.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3745/3914,

In many applications it is desirable to add new samples to a previously learnt embedding, this process of adding new samples is known as the out-of-sample extension problem. Since many manifold learning algorithms do not naturally allow for new samples to be added we present an easy to implement generalized solution to the problem that can be used with any existing manifold learning algorithm. Our algorithm is based on simple geometric intuition about the local structure of a manifold and our results show that it can be effectively used to add new samples to a previously learnt embedding.

In this paper, we propose to learn users’ preferences to product brands from their implicit feedbacks such as their searching and browsing behaviors in user Web browsing log data. The user brand preference learning problem is challenge since (1) the users’ implicit feedbacks are extremely sparse in various product domains; and (2) we can only observe positive feedbacks from users’ behaviors. In this paper, we propose a latent factor model to collaboratively mine users’ brand preferences across multiple domains simultaneously. By collective learning, the learning processes in all the domains are mutually enhanced and hence the problem of data scarcity in each single domain can be effectively addressed. On the other hand, we learn our model with an adaption of the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) optimization criterion which is a general learning framework for collaborative filtering from implicit feedbacks.

76,2011,Machine Learning,Towards Maximizing the Area Under the ROC Curve for Multi-Class Classification Problems,"Ke Tang, Rui Wang, Tianshi Chen","The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric has achieved a big success in binary classification problems since they measure the performance of classifiers without making any specific assumptions about the class distribution and misclassification costs. This is desirable because the class distribution and misclassification costs may be unknown during training process or even change in environment. MAUC, the extension of AUC to multi-class problems, has also attracted a lot of attention. However, despite the emergence of approaches for training classifiers with large AUC, little has been done for MAUC. This paper analyzes MAUC in-depth, and reveals that the maximization of MAUC can be achieved by decomposing the multi-class problem into a number of independent sub-problems. These sub-problems are formulated in the form of a “learning to rank” problem, for which well-established methods already exist. Based on the analysis, a method that employs RankBoost algorithm as the sub-problem solver is proposed to achieve classification systems with maximum MAUC. Empirical studies have shown the advantages of the proposed method over other eight relevant methods. Due to the importance of MAUC to multi-class cost-sensitive learning and class imbalanced learning problems, the proposed method is a general technique for both problems. It can also be generalized to accommodate other learning algorithms as the sub-problem solvers.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3485/3882,

Newton-CG methods are a variant of Newton method for high-dimensional problems. They only require the Hessian-vector products instead of the full Hessian matrices. To speed up Newton-CG methods for the CRF learning, we derive a novel dynamic programming procedure for the Hessian-vector products of the CRF objective function. The proposed procedure can reuse the byproducts of the time-consuming gradient computation for the Hessian-vector products to drastically reduce the total computation time of the Newton-CG methods. In experiments with tasks in natural language processing, the proposed method outperforms a conventional quasi-Newton method.

In practice, this may not always be the case. In this paper, we propose Automatic Group Sparse Coding (AutoGSC), which can (1) discover the hidden data groups; (2) learn a common dictionary over different data groups; and (3) learn an individual dictionary for each data group.

However, in many real world applications, the data features usually evolve over time smoothly. In this case, it would be very expensive in both computation and storage to rerun the whole NMF procedure after each time when the data feature changing. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (eNMF), which aims to incrementally update the factorized matrices in a computation and space efficient manner with the variation of the data matrix. We devise such evolutionary procedure for both asymmetric and symmetric NMF.

80,2011,Machine Learning,Learning Instance Specific Distance for Multi-Instance Classification,"Hua Wang, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang","Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) deals with problems where each training example is a bag, and each bag contains a set of instances. Multi-instance representation is useful in many real world applications, because it is able to capture more structural information than traditional flat single-instance representation. However, it also brings new challenges. Specifically, the distance between data objects in MIL is a set-to-set distance, which is harder to estimate than vector distances used in single-instance data. Moreover, because in MIL labels are assigned to bags instead of instances, although a bag belongs to a class, some, or even most, of its instances may not be truly related to the class. In order to address these difficulties, in this paper we propose a novel Instance Specific Distance (ISD) method for MIL, which computes the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distance by further considering the relevances of training instances with respect to their labeled classes. Taking into account the outliers caused by the weak label association in MIL, we learn ISD by solving an l0+-norm minimization problem. An efficient algorithm to solve the optimization problem is presented, together with the rigorous proof of its convergence. The promising results on five benchmark multi-instance data sets and two real world multi-instance applications validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3445/3875,

For transfer learning to be successful, it is critical to find the similarity between auxiliary and target domains, even when such mappings are not obvious. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for finding the structural similarity between two domains, to enable transfer learning at a structured knowledge level. In particular, we address the problem of how to learn a non-trivial structural similarity mapping between two different domains when they are completely different on the representation level. This problem is challenging because we cannot directly compare features across domains. Our algorithm extracts the structural features within each domain and then maps the features into the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), such that the ""structural dependencies"" of features across domains can be estimated by kernel matrices of the features within each domain. By treating the analogues from both domains as equivalent, we can transfer knowledge to achieve a better understanding of the domains and improved performance for learning.

The derivedcoefficient matrix by solving a quadratic programming problem istaken as an affinity matrix, upon which spectral clustering isapplied to obtain the ultimate segmentation result. Similar tosparse subspace clustering (SCC) and low-rank representation (LRR),SSQP is robust to data noises as validated by experiments on toydata.

In this paper, we address this challenge by showing that the deteriorative performance of K-flats can be attributed to the usual reconstruction error measure and the infinitely extending representations of linear models. Then we propose Localized K-flats algorithm (LKF), which introduces localized representations of linear models and a new distortion measure, to remove confusion among different clusters.

Usually this model can then only be used to classify data in the same feature space. However, labeled data is often expensive to obtain. A number of strategies have been developed by the machine learning community in recent years to address this problem, including: semi-supervised learning,domain adaptation,multi-task learning,and self-taught learning. While training data and test may have different distributions, they must remain in the same feature set. Furthermore, all the above methods work in the same feature space. In this paper, we consider an extreme case of transfer learning called heterogeneous transfer learning — where the feature spaces of the source task and the target tasks are disjoint. Previous approaches mostly fall in the multi-view learning category, where co-occurrence data from both feature spaces is required. We generalize the previous work on cross-lingual adaptation and propose a multi-task strategy for the task. We also propose the use of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), a special type of probabilistic graphical models, as an implementation.

These methods assume that the tasks share the same kernel, which could limit their applications because in practice different tasks may need different kernels. The main challenge of introducing multiple kernels into multiple tasks is that models from different Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) are not comparable, making it difficult to exploit relations among tasks. This paper addresses the challenge by formalizing the problem in the Square Integrable Space (SIS). Specially, it proposes a kernel based method which makes use of a regularization term defined in the SIS to represent task relations. We prove a new representer theorem for the proposed approach in SIS. We further derive a practical method for solving the learning problem and conduct consistency analysis of the method. We discuss the relations between our method and an existing method. We also give an SVM based implementation of our method for multi-label classification.

To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Matrix-variate t process Blockmodel (SMTB). In particular, we generalize a matrix-variate t distribution to a t process on matrices with nonlinear covariance functions. Due to this generalization, our model can estimate latent memberships for individual network nodes. This separates our model from previous t distribution based relational models. Also, we introduce sparse prior distributions on the latent membership parameters to select group assignments for individual nodes. To learn the model efficiently from data, we develop a variational method.

Existing algorithms usually relax the elements of cluster indicator matrix from discrete values to continuous ones. Eigenvalue decomposition is then performed to obtain a relaxed continuous solution, which must be discretized. The main problem is that the signs of the relaxed continuous solution are mixed. Such results may deviate severely from the true solution, making it a nontrivial task to get the cluster labels. To address the problem, we impose an explicit nonnegative constraint for a more accurate solution during the relaxation. Besides, we additionally introduce a discriminative regularization into the objective to avoid overfitting. A new iterative approach is proposed to optimize the objective.

In this paper, we introduce a novel transfer learning approach, namely transfer latent semantic learning, that utilizes a large number of related tagged documents with rich information from other sources (source domain) to help build a robust latent semantic space for the abbreviated texts (target domain). This is achieved by simultaneously minimizing the document reconstruction error and the classification error of the labeled examples from the source domain by building a classifier with hinge loss in the latent semantic space.

This assumption is too restrictive for general applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-task extension of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), called multi-task discriminant analysis (MTDA), which can deal with learning tasks with different data representations. For each task, MTDA learns a separate transformation which consists of two parts, one specific to the task and one common to all tasks. A by-product of MTDA is that it can alleviate the labeled data deficiency problem of LDA. Moreover, unlike many existing multi-task learning methods, MTDA can handle binary and multi-class problems for each task in a generic way.

To reduce this expensive computational complexity, we apply Kronecker products to handle the matrix completion problem. In particular, we propose using Kronecker factorization, which approximates a matrix by the Kronecker product of several matrices of smaller sizes. Weintroduce Kronecker factorization into the soft-impute framework and devise an effective matrix completion algorithm.Especially when the factorized matrices have about the samesizes, the computational complexity of our algorithm is improved substantially.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3636/3895,

This paper provides four key contributions in this context. First, it identifies a fundamentally problematic aspect of current algorithms for security games. It shows that there are many situations where these algorithms face multiple equilibria, and they arbitrarily select one that may hand the defender a significant disadvantage, particularly if the attacker deviates from its equilibrium strategies due to unknown constraints. Second, for important subclasses of security games, it identifies situations where we will face such multiple equilibria. Third, to address these problematic situations, it presents two equilibrium refinement algorithms that can optimize the defender's utility if the attacker deviates from equilibrium strategies. Finally, it experimentally illustrates that the refinement approach achieved significant robustness in consideration of attackers' deviation due to unknown constraints.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3461/3928,

Goldman","This paper studies how automated agents can persuade humans to behave in certain ways. The motivation behind such agent's behavior resides in the utility function that the agent's designer wants to maximize and which may be different from the user's utility function.  Specifically, in the strategic settings studied, the agent provides correct yet partial information about a state of the world that is unknown to the user but relevant to his decision. Persuasion games were designed to study interactions between automated players where one player sends state information to the other to persuade it to behave in a certain way. We show that this game theory based model is not sufficient to model human-agent interactions, since people tend to deviate from the rational choice. We use machine learning to model such deviation in people from this game theory based model. The agent generates a probabilistic description of the world state that maximizes its benefit and presents it to the users. The proposed model was evaluated in an extensive empirical study involving road selection tasks that differ in length, costs and congestion. Results showed that people's behavior indeed deviated significantly from the behavior predicted by the game theory based model.  Moreover, the agent developed in our model performed better than an agent that followed the behavior dictated by the game-theoretical models.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3694/3942,
95,2011,Multiagent Systems,Branch and Price for Multi-Agent Plan Recognition,"Bikramjit Banerjee, Landon Kraemer","The problem of identifying the (dynamic) team structures and team behaviors from the observed activities of multiple agents is called Multi-Agent Plan Recognition (MAPR). We extend a recent formalization of this problem to accommodate a compact, partially ordered, multi-agent plan language, as well as complex plan execution models — particularly plan abandonment and activity interleaving. We adopt a branch and price approach to solve MAPR in such a challenging setting, and fully instantiate the (generic) pricing problem for MAPR. We show experimentally that this approach outperforms a recently proposed hypothesis pruning algorithm in two domains: multi-agent blocks word, and intrusion detection. The key benefit of the branch and price approach is its ability to grow the necessary component (occurrence) space from which the hypotheses are constructed, rather than begin with a fully enumerated component space that has an intractable size, and search it with pruning. Our formulation of MAPR has the broad objective of bringing mature Operations Research methodologies to bear upon MAPR, envisaged to have a similar impact as mature SAT-solvers had on planning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3714/3945,

These search engines play a crucial role in the new generation of search paradigms where federated search engines (FSEs) integrate search results from heterogeneous sources. In this paper we pose, for the first time, the problem to design a revenue mechanism that ensures profits both to individual search engines and FSEs as a mechanism design problem. To this end, we extend the sponsored search auction models and we discuss possibility and impossibility results on the implementation of an incentive compatible mechanism. Specifically, we develop an execution-contingent VCG (where payments depend on the observed click behavior) that satisfies both individual rationality and weak budget balance in expectation.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3576/3932,

Kash","Much evidence has shown that prediction markets, when used in isolation, can effectively aggregate dispersed information about uncertain future events and produce remarkably accurate forecasts.  However, if the market prediction will be used for decision making, a strategic participant with a vested interest in the decision outcome may want to manipulate the market prediction in order to influence the resulting decision. The presence of such incentives outside of the market would seem to damage information aggregation because of the potential distrust among market participants.  While this is true under some conditions, we find that, if the existence of such incentives is certain and common knowledge, then in many cases, there exists a separating equilibrium for the market where information is fully aggregated.  This equilibrium also maximizes social welfare for convex outside payoff functions.  At this equilibrium, the participant with outside incentives makes a costly move to gain the trust of other participants.  When the existence of outside incentives is uncertain, however, trust cannot be established between players if the outside incentive is sufficiently large and we lose the separability in equilibrium.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3747/3948,

Coalitions enable agents to achieve goals that they may nothave been able to achieve on their own. Previous work hasshown problems in coalition games to be computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artifi. Intell. 2006) studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g., the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot et al. (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not all parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed tractable while others still remain intractable.We answer an important question left open by Shrot, Aumann,and Kraus by showing that the SC Problem (checking whether a Coalition is Successful) is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition. Then via a single theme of reduction from SC, we are able to show that various problems related to resources, resource bounds, and resource conflicts introduced by Wooldridge et al. are (i) W[1]-hard or co-W[1]-hard w.r.t the size of the coalition; and (ii) Para-NP hard or co-Para-NP-hard w.r.t |R|. When parameterized by |G| or |R| + |Ag|, we give a general algorithm which proves that these problems are indeed tractable.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3755/3924,

We show that these linear programs can be naturally merged into a single linear program; that this linear program can be interpreted as a formulation for the optimal correlated strategy to commit to, giving an easy proof of a result by von Stengel and Zamir that the leader's utility is at least the utility she gets in any correlated equilibrium of the simultaneous-move game; and that this linear program can be extended to compute optimal correlated strategies to commit to in games of three or more players.  (Unlike in two-player games, in games of three or more players, the notions of optimal mixed and correlated strategies to commit to are truly distinct.)

Such partial information is described by an {\em information set}, which is the set of profiles of the  non-manipulators that are indistinguishable to the manipulator. Given such an information set, a {\em dominating  manipulation} is a non-truthful vote that the manipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and  sometimes more preferable) as the winner when the  manipulator votes truthfully. When the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there exists a  dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known results). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no dominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's information is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the preferences are unknown, computing a dominating  manipulation is NP-hard for many common voting rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can prevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other voters.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3706/3944,

We introduce a natural extension of the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction, the expressive GSP (eGSP) auction, that induces truthful revelation of constraints for a rich subclass of unit-bidder types, namely downward-monotonic UBC. We establish the existence of envy-free Nash equilibrium in eGSP under a further restriction to a subclass of exclusion constraints, for which the standard GSP has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium results are obtained by reduction to equilibrium analysis for reserve price GSP (Even-Dar et al. 2008).

Given this reality, our goal is to create algorithms that learn effectively in repeated games played with minimal information.  As in other applications of machine learning, the success of a learning algorithm in repeated games depends on its learning bias.  To better understand what learning biases are most successful, we analyze the learning biases of previously published multi-agent learning (MAL) algorithms.  We then describe a new algorithm that adapts a successful learning bias from the literature to minimal information environments.  Finally, we compare the performance of this algorithm with ten other algorithms in repeated games played with minimal information.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3601/3935,

This resolves one of the last open problems in the computational complexity of manipulating common voting rules. Because of this NP-hardness, we treat computing a manipulation as an approximation problem where we try to minimize the number of manipulators. Based on ideas from bin packing and multiprocessor scheduling, we propose two new approximation methods to compute manipulations of the Borda rule. Experiments show that these methods significantly outperform the previous best known approximation method. We are able to find optimal manipulations in almost all the randomly generated elections tested. Our results suggest that, whilst computing a manipulation of the Borda rule by a coalition is NP-hard, computational complexity may provide only a weak barrier against manipulation in practice.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3613/3937,

We focus on a sub-component of this problem: given a large store of knowledge, how should an agent's task-independent memory mechanism respond to an ambiguous cue, one that pertains to multiple previously encoded memories. A large body of cognitive modeling work suggests that human memory retrievals are biased in part by the recency and frequency of past memory access. In this paper, we evaluate the functional benefit of a set of memory retrieval heuristics that incorporate these biases, in the context of the word sense disambiguation task, in which an agent must identify the most appropriate word meaning in response to an ambiguous linguistic cue. In addition, we develop methods to integrate these retrieval biases within a task-independent declarative memory system implemented in the Soar cognitive architecture and evaluate their effectiveness and efficiency in three commonly used semantic concordances.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3579/3933,

However, in general, under the VCG mechanism, payments flow out of the system of agents, which reduces the agents' utilities. VCG redistribution mechanisms aim to return as much of the VCG payments as possible back to the agents, without affecting the desirable properties of the VCG mechanism. Most previous research on VCG redistribution mechanisms has focused on settings with homogeneous items and/or settings with unit-demand agents. In this paper, we study VCG redistribution mechanisms in the more general setting of combinatorial auctions. We show that when the gross substitutes condition holds, we are able to design mechanisms that guarantee to redistribute a large fraction of the VCG payments.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3733/3947,

We focus on imperfect information extensive-form games in which one or more actions at many decision points have an associated continuous or many-valued parameter.  A stock trading agent, in addition to deciding whether to buy or not, must decide how much to buy.  In no-limit poker, in addition to selecting a probability for each action, the agent must decide how much to bet for each betting action. Selecting values for these parameters makes these games extremely large. Two-player no-limit Texas Hold'em poker with stacks of 500 big blinds has approximately 1071 states, which is more than 1050 times more states than two-player limit Texas Hold'em.  The main contribution of this paper is a technique that abstracts a game's action space by selecting one, or a small number, of the many values for each parameter. We show that strategies computed using this new algorithm for no-limit Leduc poker exhibit significant utility gains over epsilon-Nash equilibrium strategies computed with standard, hand-crafted parameter value abstractions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3707/3943,

In our implementation, the auction is able to automatically detect, as the rounds progress, whether price expressiveness must be increased to clear the market. The auction also features a configurable step size which can be tuned to trade-off between monotonicity in prices and the number of bidding rounds, with no impact on efficiency.

This allows us to scale to problems with hundreds of tasks and agents. We empirically evaluate our algorithm against established benchmarks and find that, even in such large environments, a solution is found up to 31% faster, and with up to 23% more utility, than state-of-the-art approximation algorithms.

However, in many real-world applications, there are inherent constraints on feasible coalitions: for instance, certain agents may be prohibited from being in the same coalition, or the coalition structure may be required to consist of coalitions of the same size.  In this paper, we present the first systematic study of constrained coalition formation (CCF). We propose a general framework for this problem, and identify an important class of CCF settings, where the constraints specify which groups of agents should/should not work together. We describe a procedure that transforms such constraints into a structured input that allows coalition formation algorithms to identify, without any redundant computations, all the feasible coalitions. We then use this procedure to develop an algorithm for generating an optimal (welfare-maximizing) constrained coalition structure, and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by several orders of magnitude.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3776/3925,

In this paper, we investigate both classic and parameterized computational complexity of electoral campaign management under such rules. We focus on two methods that can be used to promote a given candidate: asking voters to move this candidate upwards in their preference order or asking them to change the number of candidates they approve of.  We show that finding an optimal campaign management strategy of the first type is easy for both Bucklin and Fallback.  In contrast, the second method is computationally hard even if the degree to which we need to affect the votes is small.

We show how ants can use repellent pheromones and incorporate the effect of crowding to avoid traffic congestion on the optimal path. Based on these interactions, we propose an ant algorithm, the M-unit EigenAnt algorithm, that leads to the selection of the M shortest paths. The ratio of selection of each of these paths is also optimal and regulated by an optimal amount of pheromone on each of them. To the best of our knowledge, the M-unit EigenAnt algorithm is the first antalgorithm that explicitly ensures the selection of the M shortest paths and regulates the amount of  pheromone on them such that it is asymptotically optimal. In fact, it is in contrast with most ant algorithms that aim to discover just a single best path. We provide its convergence analysis and show that the steady state distribution of pheromone aligns with the eigenvectors of the cost matrix, and thus is related to its measure of quality. We also provide analysis to show that this property ensues even when the food is moved or path lengths change during foraging. We show that this behavior is robust in the presence of fluctuations and quickly reflects the change in the M optimal solutions. This makes it suitable for not only distributed applications butalso dynamic ones as well. Finally, we provide simulation results for the convergence to the optimal solution under different initial biases, dynamism in lengths of paths, and discovery of new paths.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3662/3941,

This can reduce agent communication, and further, potentially increase privacy in the sense that agents reveal no more private information than is needed to determine an optimal outcome. This is not always possible: previous work has explored the tradeoff between communication cost and efficiency, and more recently, communication and privacy. We explore a third dimension: the tradeoff between privacy and efficiency. By sacrificing efficiency, we can improve the privacy of a variety of existing mechanisms. We analyze these tradeoffs in both second-price auctions and facility location problems (introducing new incremental mechanisms for facility location along the way).

Networked Distributed POMDP (ND-POMDP) provides a framework to model such cooperative multi-agent decision making. Existing work on ND-POMDPs has focused on offline techniques that require accurate models, which are usually costly to obtain in practice. This paper presents a model-free, scalable learning approach that synthesizes multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). By exploiting structured interaction in ND-POMDPs, our approach distributes the learning of the joint policy and employs DCOP techniques to coordinate distributed learning to ensure the global learning performance. Our approach can learn a globally optimal policy for ND-POMDPs with a property called groupwise observability. Experimental results show that, with communication during learning and execution, our approach significantly outperforms the nearly-optimal non-communication policies computed offline.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3750/3950,

Grosz","When interacting with computer agents, people make inferences about various characteristics of these agents, such as their reliability and trustworthiness. These perceptions are significant, as they influence people's behavior towards the agents, and may foster or inhibit repeated interactions between them. In this paper we investigate whether computer agents can use the expression of emotion to influence human perceptions of trustworthiness. In particular, we study human-computer interactions within the context of a negotiation game, in which players make alternating offers to decide on how to divide a set of resources. A series of negotiation games between a human and several agents is then followed by a ""trust game."" In this game people have to choose one among several agents to interact with, as well as how much of their resources they will trust to it. Our results indicate that, among those agents that displayed emotion, those whose expression was in accord with their actions (strategy) during the negotiation game were generally preferred as partners in the trust game over those whose emotion expressions and actions did not mesh. Moreover, we observed that when emotion does not carry useful new information, it fails to strongly influence human decision-making behavior in a negotiation setting.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3438/3951,

We propose a model of co-evolving networks where both node attributes and network structure evolve under mutual influence. Specifically, we consider a mixed membership stochastic blockmodel, where the probability of observing a link between two nodes depends on their current membership vectors, while those membership vectors themselves evolve in the presence of a link between the nodes. Thus, the network is shaped by the interaction of stochastic processes describing the nodes, while the processes themselves are influenced by the changing  network structure. We  derive an efficient variational inference procedure for our model, and validate the model on both synthetic and real-world data.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3783/3963,

GDL inherits from Datalog the use of Horn clauses as rules and recursion, but it too requires stratification and does not allow to use quantifiers. We present an alternative formalism for game description which is based on first-order logic (FO). States of the game are represented by relational structures, legal moves by structure rewriting rules guarded by FO formulas, and the goals of the players by formulas which extend FO with counting. The advantage of our formalism comes from more explicit state representationcand from the use of quantifiers in formulas. We show how to exploit existential quantification in players' goals to generate heuristics for evaluating positions in the game. The derived heuristics are good enough for a basic alpha-beta agent to win against state of the art GGP.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3727/3961,

However, it is not a trivial task to detect grammatical errors in oral conversations because of the unavoidable errors of automatic speech recognition systems. To provide corrective feedback, a novel method to detect grammatical errors in speaking performance is proposed. The proposed method consists of two sub-models: the grammaticality-checking model and the error-type classification model. We automatically generate grammatical errors that learners are likely to commit and construct error patterns based on the articulated errors. When a particular speech pattern is recognized, the grammaticality-checking model performs a binary classification based on the similarity between the error patterns and the recognition result using the confidence score. The error-type classification model chooses the error type based on the most similar error pattern and the error frequency extracted from a learner corpus. The grammaticality checking method largely outperformed the two comparative models by 56.36% and 42.61% in F-score while keeping the false positive rate very low. The error-type classification model exhibited very high performance with a 99.6% accuracy rate. Because high precision and a low false positive rate are important criteria for the language-tutoring setting, the proposed method will be helpful for intelligent computer-assisted language learning systems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3501/3954,

128,2011,Multidisciplinary Topics,Comparing Agents' Success against People in Security Domains,"Raz Lin, Sarit Kraus, Noa Agmon, Samuel Barrett, Peter Stone","The interaction of people with autonomous agents has become increasingly prevalent. Some of these settings include security domains, where people can be characterized as uncooperative, hostile, manipulative, and tending to take advantage of the situation for their own needs. This makes it challenging to design proficient agents to interact with people in such environments. Evaluating the success of the agents automatically before evaluating them with people or deploying them could alleviate this challenge and result in better designed agents. In this paper we show how Peer Designed Agents (PDAs) -- computer agents developed by human subjects -- can be used as a method for evaluating autonomous agents in security domains. Such evaluation can reduce the effort and costs involved in evaluating autonomous agents interacting with people to validate their efficacy. Our experiments included more than 70 human subjects and 40 PDAs developed by students. The study provides empirical support that PDAs can be used to compare the proficiency of autonomous agents when matched with people in security domains.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3470/3952,

Cortigo uses a hierarchical generative model loosely related to the human visual cortex to recognize Go board positions well enough to suggest promising next moves. We begin by briefly describing and providing motivation for research in the computer Go domain.

In this paper, we propose the novel problem of predicting mobile application (known as “apps”) installation using social networks and explain its challenge. Modern smart phones, like the ones used in our study, are able to collect different social networks using built-in sensors. (e.g. Bluetooth proximity network, call log network, etc) While this information is accessible to app market makers such as the iPhone AppStore, it has not yet been studied how app market makers can use these information for marketing research and strategy development. We develop a simple computational model to better predict app installation by using a composite network computed from the different networks sensed by phones. Our model also captures individual variance and exogenous factors in app adoption. We show the importance of considering all these factors in predicting app installations, and we observe the surprising result that app installation is indeed predictable. We also show that our model achieves the best results compared with generic approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3729/3964,

Central to the Mental Model Theory (MMT), is the assumption that the human reasoning process can be divided into three phases: (i) Mental model construction, (ii) model inspection, and (iii) model validation. The MMT can be formalized with respect to a computational model, connecting the reasoning process to operations on mental model representations. In this respect a computational model has been implemented in the cognitive architecture ACT-R capable of explaining human reasoning difficulty by the number of model operations. The presented ACT-R model allows simulation of psychological findings about spatial reasoning problems from a previous study that investigated conventional behavioral data such as response times and error rates in the context of certain mental model construction principles.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3697/3958,

Intrinsic quality is estimated via evaluations given by computer chess programs run to high depth, ideally so that their playing strength is sufficiently far ahead of the best human players as to be a `relatively omniscient' guide. Several formulas, each having intrinsic skill parameters s for `sensitivity' and c for `consistency', are argued theoretically and tested by regression on large sets of tournament games played by humans of varying strength as measured by the internationally standard Elo rating system. This establishes a correspondence between Elo rating and the parameters. A smooth correspondence is shown between statistical results and the century points on the Elo scale, and ratings are shown to have stayed quite constant over time. That is, there has been little or no `rating inflation'. The theory and empirical results are transferable to other rational-choice settings in which the alternatives have well-defined utilities, but in which complexity and bounded information constrain the perception of the utility values.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3779/3962,

Action formalisms like the Situation Calculus have been developed for precisely this purpose. In this paper we present a full embedding of the Game Description Language into the Situation Calculus (with Scherl and Levesque's  knowledge fluent).

We propose a novel collaboration policy based on the Co-Training algorithm in machine learning, in which the two people play the role of the base learners. The policy restricts each learner's view of the data and limits their communication to only the exchange of their labelings on test items. In a series of empirical studies, we show that the Co-Training policy leads collaborators to jointly produce unique and potentially valuable classification outcomes that are not generated under other collaboration policies.

Given no prior linguistic knowledge, the system learns by simply observing how humans follow navigation instructions.  The system is evaluated in three complex virtual indoor environments with numerous objects and landmarks.  A previously collected realistic corpus of complex English navigation instructions for these environments is used for training and testing data.

The core idea of our approach is a novel word induction criterion called WordRank, which estimates the goodness of word hypotheses (character or phoneme sequences). We devise a method to derive exterior word boundary information from the link structures of adjacent word hypotheses and incorporate interior word boundary information to complete the model. In light of WordRank, word segmentation can be modeled as an optimization problem. A Viterbi-styled algorithm is developed for the search of the optimal segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on phonetic transcripts as well as standard Chinese and Japanese data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the standard Brent version of Bernstein-Ratner corpora, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art Bayesian models by more than 3%.

This paper describes a type independent search and candidate generation paradigm for QA that leverages Wikipedia characteristics. This approach is particularly useful for adapting QA systems to domains where reliable answer type identification and type-based answer extraction are not available. We present a three-pronged search approach motivated by relations an answer-justifying title-oriented document may have with the question/answer pair. We further show how Wikipedia metadata such as anchor texts and redirects can be utilized to effectively extract candidate answers from search results without a type ontology. Our experimental results show that our strategies obtained high binary recall in both search and candidate generation on TREC questions, a domain that has mature answer type extraction technology, as well as on Jeopardy! questions, a domain without such technology.

Inspired by ideas from lossy counting, we divide a stream of items into multiple windows, and decrement certain counts in the sketch at window boundaries. We refer to this approach as a lossy conservative update (LCU). The reduction in overestimation error of counts comes at the cost of introducing under-estimation error in counts. However, in our intrinsic evaluations, we show that the reduction in overestimation is much greater than the under-estimation error introduced by our method LCU. We apply our LCU framework to scale distributional similarity computations to web-scale corpora. We show that this technique is more efficient in terms of memory, and time, and more robust than conservative update with Count-Min (CU) sketch on this task.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3757/3976,

This problem can be solved by automatically labeling some negative (and more positive) examples from unlabeled examples before training a text classifier. But it is difficult to guarantee both high quality and quantity of the new labeled examples. In this paper, a multi-level example based learning method for partially supervised text classification is proposed, which can make full use of all unlabeled examples. A heuristic method is proposed to assign possible labels to unlabeled examples and partition them into multiple levels according to their labeling confidence. A text classifier is trained on these multi-level examples using weighted support vector machines.

One main challenge of the task is the lack of annotated tweets, which is required to train a statistical model. We introduce self-training to SRL, leveraging abundant unlabeled tweets to alleviate its depending on annotated tweets. A novel strategy of tweet selection is presented, ensuring the chosen tweets are both correct and informative. More specifically, the correctness is estimated according to the labeling confidences and agreement of two Conditional Random Fields based labelers, which are trained on the randomly evenly spitted labeled data; while the informativeness is in proportion to the maximum distance between the tweet and the already selected tweets.

This induction set-up is attractive because such annotations provide useful clues about the underlying syntactic structure, and they are readily available in many domains (e.g., info-boxes and HTML markup). Our method is based on the intuition that syntactic realizations of the same semantic predicate exhibit some degree of consistency. We incorporate this intuition in a directed graphical model that tightly links the syntactic and semantic structures. This design enables us to exploit syntactic regularities while still allowing for variations. Another strength of the model lies in its ability to capture non-local dependency relations. Our results demonstrate that even a small amount of semantic annotations greatly improves the accuracy of learned dependencies when tested on both in-domain and out-of-domain texts.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3741/3975,

Ourexperiments on a number of datasets from two different domains show that certain properties of latent networks like clustering coefﬁcient, average shortest path,and connected components exhibit patterns that are signiﬁcantly divergent from randomized networks. We explain that these patterns reﬂect the network phase transition as well as the existence of a community structure in document collections.

OCS often enjoy access to predictions of future events that have substantial impact on their operations. For example, reliable forecasts of extreme weather conditions are widely available, and such events can affect typical request patterns for customer response management systems, the flight and service time of airplanes, or the supply and demand patterns for electricity. The space of exogenous events impacting OCS can be very large, prohibiting their modeling within the MDP; moreover, for many of these exogenous events there is no useful predictive, probabilistic model. Realtime predictions, however, possibly with a short lead-time, are often available. In this work we motivate a model which combines offline MDP infinite horizon planning with realtime adjustments given specific predictions of future exogenous events, and suggest a framework in which such predictions are captured and trigger real-time planning problems.

We use numerical optimization to solve for the joint behavior of an eye and two hands, deriving a predicted motion pattern from first principles, without imposing heuristics. We model the planar scene as a POMDP with 17 continuous state dimensions. Belief-space optimization is facilitated by using a nominal-belief heuristic, whereby we assume (during planning) that the maximum likelihood observation is always obtained. Since a globally-optimal solution for such a high-dimensional domain is computationally intractable, we employ local optimization in the belief domain. By solving for a locally-optimal plan through belief space, we generate a motion pattern of mutual coordination between hands and eye: the eye's saccades disambiguate the scene in a task-relevant manner, and the hands' motions anticipate the eye's saccades. Finally, the model is validated through a behavioral experiment, in which human subjects perform the same eye-hand coordination task.

To do this, the paper  first shows how encoding plan libraries as context free grammars  permits the application of standard rewriting techniques to remove  left recursion and ε-productions, thereby enabling  polynomial time parsing.  However, these techniques alone fail  to provide efficient algorithms for plan recognition.

On the one hand, the planning process must be lightweight, robust, and timely. Over the lifetime of the robot it must always respond quickly with new plans that accommodate exogenous events, changing objectives, and the underlying unpredictability of the environment. On the other hand, in order to promote efficient behaviours the planning process must perform computationally expensive reasoning about contingencies and possible revisions of subjective beliefs according to quantitatively modelled uncertainty in acting and sensing. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a continual planning approach that switches between using a fast satisficing ""classical"" planner, to decide on the overall strategy, and decision-theoretic planning to solve small abstract subproblems where deeper consideration of the sensing model is both practical, and can significantly impact overall performance.

Abstracting the underlying graph yields a simpler problem whose solution can be used, by refinement, as a guide to a solution to the original problem. A fruitful way to view domain independent planning problems is as a collection of multi-valued variables that must perform synchronised transitions through graphs of possible values, where the edges are defined by the domain actions. Planning involves finding efficient paths through Domain Transition Graphs (DTGs). In problems where these graphs are large, planning can be  prohibitively expensive.

To answer that question, this paper introduces the Bipartite Traveling Tournament Problem (BTTP), the inter-league extension of the well-studied Traveling Tournament Problem. We prove that the 2n-team BTTP is NP-complete, but for small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers.  We apply our algorithm to the 12-team Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league in Japan, creating an inter-league tournament that reduces total team travel by 16% compared to the actual schedule played by these teams during the 2010 NPB season.  We also analyze the problem of inter-league scheduling for the 30-team National Basketball Association (NBA), and develop a tournament schedule whose total inter-league travel distance is just 3.8% higher than the trivial theoretical lower bound. ",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3459/3978,

Assuming that the state of the variables is fully observable, we obtain two results. First, the solution to the problem can be expressed as a policy mapping qualitative states into actions, where a qualitative state includes a Boolean variable for each original variable, indicating whether its value is zero or not. Second, testing whether any such policy, that may express nested loops of actions, is a solution to the problem, can be determined in time that is polynomial in the qualitative state space, which is much smaller than the original infinite state space.

We claim that traditional heuristic MDP algorithms have been unsuccessful due mostly to the lack of efficient heuristics in structured domains. Previous attempts like mGPT used classical planning heuristics to an all-outcome determinization of MDPs without discount factor; yet, discounted optimization is required to solve problems with potential dead-ends. We propose a general extension of classical planning heuristics to goal-oriented discounted MDPs, in order to overcome this flaw. We apply our theoretical analysis to the well-known classical planning heuristics Hmax and Hadd, and prove that the extended Hmax is admissible. We plugged our extended heuristics to popular graph-based (Improved-LAO*, LRTDP, LDFS) and ADD-based (sLAO*, sRTDP) MDP algorithms: experimental evaluations highlight competitive results compared with the winners of previous competitions (FF-Replan, FPG, RFF), and show that our discounted heuristics solve more problems than non-discounted ones, with better criteria values.

Bui","Aggregate factors (that is, those based on aggregate functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, AND etc.) in probabilistic relational models can compactly represent dependencies among a large number of relational random variables. However, propositional inference on a factor aggregating n k-valued random variables into an r-valued result random variable is O(r k 2n). Lifted methods can ameliorate this to O(r nk) in general and O(r k log n) for commutative associative aggregators. In this paper, we propose (a) an exact solution constant in n when k = 2 for certain aggregate operations such as AND, OR and SUM, and (b) a close approximation for inference with aggregate factors with time complexity constant in n. This approximate inference involves an analytical solution for some operations when k > 2. The approximation is based on the fact that the typically used aggregate functions can be represented by linear constraints in the standard (k –1)-simplex in Rk where k is the number of possible values for random variables. This includes even aggregate functions that are commutative but not associative (e.g., the MODE operator that chooses the most frequent value). Our algorithm takes polynomial time in k (which is only 2 for binary variables) regardless of r and n, and the error decreases as n increases. Therefore, for most applications (in which a close approximation suffices) our algorithm is a much more efficient solution than existing algorithms. We present experimental results supporting these claims. We also present a (c) third contribution which further optimizes aggregations over multiple groups of random variables with distinct distributions.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3797/3999,

Computing the (minimal) treewidth is NPcomplete, so stochastic algorithms are sometimes used to find low width tree decompositions. A common approach for finding good decompositions is iteratively executing a greedy triangulation algorithm (e.g. minfill) with randomized tie-breaking. However, utilizing a stochastic algorithm as part of the inference task introduces a new problem — namely, deciding how long the stochastic algorithm should be allowed to execute before performing inference on the best tree decomposition found so far. We refer to this dilemma as the Stopping Problem and formalize it in terms of the total time needed to answer a probabilistic query. We propose a rule for discontinuing the search for improved decompositions and demonstrate the benefit (in terms of time saved) of applying this rule to Bayes and Markov network instances.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3654/3996,

These techniques are often used in NLP and vision applications. However, no coarse-to-fine inference or learning methods have been developed for general first-order probabilistic domains, where the potential gains are even higher. We present our Coarse-to-Fine Probabilistic Inference (CFPI) framework for general coarse-to-fine inference for first-order probabilistic models, which leverages a given or induced type hierarchy over objects in the domain. Starting by considering the inference problem at the coarsest type level, our approach performs inference at successively finer grains, pruning high- and low-probability atoms before refining. CFPI can be applied with any probabilistic inference method and can be used in both propositional and relational domains. CFPI provides theoretical guarantees on the errors incurred, and these guarantees can be tightened when CFPI is applied to specific inference algorithms. We also show how to learn parameters in a coarse-to-fine manner to maximize the efficiency of CFPI. We evaluate CFPI with the lifted belief propagation algorithm on social network link prediction and biomolecular event prediction tasks.

On the one hand, waiting to obtain more information reduces the uncertainty, but it comes with a cost. On the other hand, stopping and making a decision based on an expected utility, decreases the cost of waiting, but the decision is made based on uncertain information. In this paper, we prove that computing the optimal time to make a decision that guarantees the optimal utility is NP-hard.

DD  methods decompose a complex model into a collection of simpler  subproblems that can be solved exactly (such as trees), that in  combination provide upper and lower bounds on the exact solution.  Subproblem choice can play a major role:  larger subproblems tend to improve the bound more per iteration,  while smaller subproblems enable highly parallel solvers and can  benefit from re-using past solutions when there are few changes  between iterations. We propose an algorithm that can balance many of these aspects to  speed up convergence.  Our method uses a cluster tree  data structure that has been proposed for adaptive exact inference  tasks, and we apply it in this paper to dual-decomposition  approximate inference.  This approach allows us to process large  subproblems to improve the bounds at each iteration, while allowing  a high degree of parallelizability and taking advantage of  subproblems with sparse updates.

This is significant because both decision making and game play in multiagent settings must contend with behavioral models of other agents in order to predict their actions. One approach that reduces the complexity of the model space is to group models that are behaviorally equivalent. Identifying equivalence between models requires solving them and comparing entire policy trees. Because the trees grow exponentially with the horizon, our approach is to focus on partial policy trees for comparison and determining the distance between updated beliefs at the leaves of the trees. We propose a principled way to determine how much of the policy trees to consider, which trades off solution quality for efficiency.

In this paper we concentrate on frequency-based patrol, in which the agents' goal is to optimize a frequency criterion, namely, minimizing the time between visits to a set of interest points. We consider multiagent patrol in environments with complex environmental conditions that affect the cost of traveling from one point to another. For example, in marine environments, the travel time of ships depends on parameters such as wind, water currents, and waves. We demonstrate that in such environments there is a need to consider a new multiagent patrol strategy which divides the given area into parts in which more than one agent is active, for improving frequency. We show that in general graphs this problem is intractable, therefore we focus on simplified (yet realistic) cyclic graphs with possible inner edges. Although the problem remains generally intractable in such graphs, we provide a heuristic algorithm that is shown to significantly improve point-visit frequency compared to other patrol strategies. For evaluation of our work we used a custom developed ship simulator that realistically models ship movement constraints such as engine force and drag and reaction of the ship to environmental changes.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3564/4001,

We define some classes of abstractions and we provide parametric algorithms to automatically generate abstractions.

We compare two strategies for selecting action queries: 1) based on myopically maximizing expected gain in long-term value, and 2) based on myopically minimizing uncertainty in the agent's policy representation.

These techniques use only  positive examples (i.e., descriptions) when building their models. In this work, a maximum entropy based extension is proposed for context language models so as to account for regularities across non-descriptions mined from web-snippets.  Experiments show that this extension outperforms other strategies increasing the precision of the top five ranked answers by more than 5%.  Results suggest  that web-snippets are a cost-efficient source of non-descriptions, and that some relationships extracted from dependency trees are effective to mine for candidate answer sentences.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3437/4055,

Liu, Qiang Yang","The new user problem (aka user cold start) is very common in online recommender systems. Active collaborative ﬁltering (active CF) tries to solve this problem by intelligently soliciting user feedback in order to build an initial user proﬁle with minimal costs. Existing methods only query the user for feedback on items, while users can have preferences over items as well as certain item attributes. In this paper, we extend active CF via user feedback on both items and attributes. For example, when making movie recommendations, the system can ask users for not only their favorite movies, but also attributes such as genres, actors, etc. We design a uniﬁed active CF framework for incorporating both item and attribute feedback based on the random walk model. We test the active CF algorithm on real-world movie recommendation data sets to demonstrate that appropriately querying for both item and feature feedback can signiﬁcantly reduce the overall user effort measured in terms of number of queries. We show that we can achieve much better recommendation quality as compared to traditional active CF methods that support only item feedback.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3622/4067,

Following the vision of using domain-independent planning and declarative complex goals to generate compositions based on atomic service descriptions, we apply a planning framework based on Constraint Satisfaction techniques to a domain consisting of WSs with diverse functionalities. One of the key requirements of such domains is the ability to address the incomplete knowledge problem, as well as recovering from failures that may occur during execution. We propose an algorithm for interleaving planning, monitoring and execution, where continual planning via altering the CSP is performed, under the light of the feedback acquired at runtime. The system is evaluated against a number of scenarios including real WSs, demonstrating the leverage of situations that can be effectively tackled with respect to previous approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3493/4059,

On one hand, users have an inordinate number of choices; on the other hand, users are constrained by limited time and resources and have to choose sites in order to remain social and active. Hence, dynamic social media entails user migration, a well studied phenomenon in fields such as sociology and psychology. Users are valuable assets for social media sites as they help contribute to the growth of a site and generate revenue by increased traffic. We are intrigued to know if social media user migration can be studied, and what migration patterns are. In particular, we investigate whether people migrate, and if they do, how they migrate. We formalize site and attention migration to help identify the migration between popular social media sites and determine clear patterns of migration between sites. This work suggests a feasible way to study migration patterns in social media. The discovered patterns can help understand social media sites and gauge their popularity to improve business intelligence and revenue generation through the retention of users.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3664/4070,

However, existing approaches, largely syntactic content-based, fail to provide robust, accurate and useful personalized services to its users. Towards such an issue, the semantic web provides technologies to annotate and match services’ descriptions with users’ features, interests and preferences, thus allowing for more efficient access to services and more generally information. The aim of our work, part of service personalization, is on automated instantiation of services which is crucial for advanced usability i.e., how to prepare and present services ready to be executed while limiting useless interactions with users?

This necessitates the evaluation of the trustworthiness between two unknown participants along the social trust paths between them based on the trust transitivity properties (i.e., if A trusts B and B trusts C, then A can trust C to some extent). In order to compute more reasonable trust value between two unknown participants, a critical and challenging problem is to make clear how and to what extent trust is transitive along a social trust path. To address this problem, we first propose a new complex social network structure that takes, besides trust, social relationships, recommendation roles and preference similarity between participants into account. These factors have significant influence on trust transitivity. We then propose a general concept, called Quality of Trust Transitivity (QoTT), that takes any factor with impact on trust transitivity as an attribute to illustrate the ability of a trust path to guarantee a certain level of quality in trust transitivity. Finally, we propose a novel Multiple QoTT Constrained Trust Transitivity (MQCTT) model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that our proposed MQCTT model follows the properties of trust and the principles illustrated in social psychology, and thus can compute more resonable trust values than existing methods that consider neither the impact of social aspects nor the properties of trust.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3633/4069,

However in commercial search engines, collecting high quality labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To tackle this issue, this paper studies how to produce the true relevance labels for  <query, URL> pairs using clickthrough data. By analyzing the correlations between query frequency, true relevance labels and users’ behaviors, we demonstrate that the users who search the queries with similar frequency have similar search intents and behavioral characteristics. Based on such properties, we propose an efficient discriminative parameter estimation in a multiple instance learning algorithm (MIL) to automatically produce true relevance labels for  <query, URL> pairs. Furthermore, we test our approach using a set of real world data extracted from a Chinese commercial search engine. Experimental results not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but also indicate that our approach is more likely to agree with the aggregation of the multiple judgments when strong disagreements exist in the panel of judges. In the event that the panel of judges is consensus, our approach provides more accurate automatic label results.

Given a source domain knowledge concerning the Moon, ""The Moon is a satellite of the Earth,"" one can form a question {(Moon, Earth), (Ganymede, ?)} to query an LRS engine for new knowledge in the target domain concerning the Ganymede. An LRS engine relies on some supporting sentences such as ``Ganymede is a natural satellite of Jupiter.'' to retrieve and rank ""Jupiter"" as the first answer. This paper proposes cross-language latent relational search (CLRS) to extend the knowledge mapping capability of LRS from cross-domain knowledge mapping to cross-domain and cross-language knowledge mapping. In CLRS, the supporting sentences for the source pair might be in a different language with that of the target pair. We represent the relation between two entities in an entity pair by lexical patterns of the context surrounding the two entities. We then propose a novel hybrid lexical pattern clustering algorithm to capture the semantic similarity between paraphrased lexical patterns across languages.

As there are no simple semantic mappings between the taxonomies of the CQA services, the integration of CQA services is a challenging task.

Given data streams representing blog posts on multiple blog channels and a focal query post on some topic of interest, our objective is to predict which of those channels are most likely to contain a future post that is relevant, or similar, to the focal query post. We denote this task as the future author prediction problem (FAPP). This problem has applications in information diffusion for brand monitoring and blog channel personalization and recommendation. We develop prediction methods inspired by (naive) information retrieval approaches that use historical posts in the blog channel for prediction. We also train a ranking support vector machine (SVM) to solve the problem.

Current tag-based recommender systems mainly take the explicit structural information among users, resources and tags into consideration, while neglecting the important implicit semantic relationships hidden in tagging data.

Comparing to receiving results from web search engines using keyword queries, CQA users are likely to get more specific answers, because human answerers may catch the main point of the question. However, one of the key problems of this pattern is that sometimes no one helps to give answers, while web search engines hardly fail to response. In this paper, we analyze the not-answered questions and give a first try of predicting whether questions will receive answers. More specifically, we first analyze the questions of Yahoo Answers based on the features selected from different perspectives. Then, we formalize the prediction problem as supervised learning – binary classification problem and leverage the proposed features to make predictions. Extensive experiments are made on 76,251 questions collected from Yahoo! Answers.

While the polarity of words in the documents is informative for this task, polarity of some words cannot be determined without domain knowledge. Detecting word polarity thus poses a challenge for multiple-domain sentiment analysis. Previous approaches tackle this problem with transfer learning techniques, but they cannot handle multiple source domains and multiple target domains. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian probabilistic model to handle multiple source and multiple target domains. In this model, each word is associated with three factors: Domain label, domain dependence/independence and word polarity. We derive an efficient algorithm using Gibbs sampling for inferring the parameters of the model, from both labeled and unlabeled texts. Using real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in a document polarity classification task compared with a method not considering the differences between domains. Moreover our method can also tell whether each word's polarity is domain-dependent or domain-independent.

It has been mentioned that a combined use of good and bad seeds can lead to better results. However, little work has been known to realize this insight successfully. A serious issue of existing algorithms is that trust/distrust is propagated in non-differential ways. However, it seems to be impossible to implement differential propagation if only trust or distrust is propagated. In this paper, we view that each Web page has both a trustworthy side and an untrustworthy side, and assign two scores to each Web page: T-Rank, scoring the trustworthiness, and D-Rank, scoring the untrustworthiness. We then propose an integrated framework which propagates both trust and distrust. In the framework, the propagation of T-Rank/D-Rank is penalized by the target's current D-Rank/T-Rank. In this way, propagating both trust and distrust with target differentiation is implemented. The proposed Trust-Distrust Rank (TDR) algorithm not only makes full use of both good seeds and bad seeds, but also overcomes the disadvantages of both existing trust propagation and distrust propagation algorithms.

In situations where the training data in a target domain are not sufficient to learn predictive models effectively, transfer learning leverages auxiliary source data from other related source domains for learning. While most of the existing works in this area only focused on using the source data with the same structure as the target data, in this paper, we push this boundary further by proposing a heterogeneous transfer learning framework for knowledge transfer between text and images. We observe that for a target-domain classification problem, some annotated images can be found on many social Web sites, which can serve as a bridge to transfer knowledge from the abundant text documents available over the Web. A key question is how to effectively transfer the knowledge in the source data even though the text can be arbitrarily found. Our solution is to enrich the representation of the target images with semantic concepts extracted from the auxiliary source data through a novel matrix factorization method. By using the latent semantic features generated by the auxiliary data, we are able to build a better integrated image classifier.

Routes are optimized with respect to travel time, with the intention of saving the driver both time and fuel, and rerouting can occur if warranted. During a routing session, client phones communicate with a centralized server that both collects GPS data and processes route requests. All relevant data are anonymized and saved to databases for analysis; statistics are calculated from the aggregate data and fed back to the routing engine to improve future routing. Analyses can also be performed to discern driver trends: where do drivers tend to go, how long do they stay, when and where does traffic congestion occur, and so on. The system uses a number of techniques from the field of artificial intelligence. We apply a variant of A* search for solving the stochastic shortest path problem in order to find optimal driving routes through a network of roads given light-status information.

They showed that by leveraging the capacities of autonomous vehicles it is possible to dramatically reduce the time wasted in traffic, and therefore also fuel consumption and air pollution. The proposed protocol, however, handles reservation requests one at a time and does not prioritize reservations according to their relative priorities and waiting times, causing potentially large inequalities in granting reservations. For example, at an intersection between a main street and an alley, vehicles from the alley can take an excessively long time to get reservations to enter the intersection, causing a waste of time and fuel. The same is true in a network of intersections, in which gridlock may occur and cause traffic congestion. In this paper, we introduce the batch processing of reservations in AIM to enforce liveness properties in intersections and analyze the conditions under which no vehicle will get stuck in traffic.

This phenomenon, known as facilitation, occurs in water-stressed environments when shade from larger shrubs protects smaller annuals from harsh sun, enabling them to exist on scarce water. The topic of this paper is a model of this phenomenon that allows search algorithms to find residential landscape designs that incorporate facilitation to conserve water. This model is based in botany; it captures the growth requirements of real plant species in a fitness function, but also includes a penalty term in that function that encourages facilitative interactions with other plants on the landscape. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, two search strategies--simulated annealing and agent-based search--were applied to models of different collections of simulated plant types and landscapes with different light distributions. These two search strategies produced landscape designs with different spatial distributions of the larger plants.

Dietterich","Important ecological phenomena are often observed indirectly. Consequently, probabilistic latent variable models provide an important tool, because they can include explicit models of the ecological phenomenon of interest and the process by which it is observed.  However, existing latent variable methods rely on hand-formulated parametric models, which are expensive to design and require extensive preprocessing of the data.  Nonparametric methods (such as regression trees) automate these decisions and produce highly accurate models. However, existing tree methods learn direct mappings from inputs to outputs — they cannot be applied to latent variable models. This paper describes a methodology for integrating nonparametric tree methods into probabilistic latent variable models by extending functional gradient boosting. The approach is presented in the context of occupancy-detection (OD) modeling, where the goal is to model the distribution of a species from imperfect detections. Experiments on 12 real and 3 synthetic bird species compare standard and tree-boosted OD models (latent variable models) with standard and tree-boosted logistic regression models (without latent structure).  All methods perform similarly when predicting the observed variables, but the OD models learn better representations of the latent process.

Using both parametric and non-parametric learning methods, we learn models that predict distributions over energy usage based upon these features, and use these models to develop two end-user systems.  For utilities or authorized institutions (those who may obtain access to the full data) we provide a system that visualizes energy consumption for each building in the city; this allows companies to quickly identify outliers (buildings which use much more energy than expected even after conditioning on the relevant predictors), for instance allowing them to target homes for potential retrofits or tiered pricing schemes.  For other end users, we provide an interface for entering their own electricity and gas usage, along with basic information about their home, to determine how their consumption compares to that of similar buildings as predicted by our model.  Merely allowing users to contextualize their consumption in this way, relating it to the consumption in similar buildings, can itself produce behavior changes to significantly reduce consumption.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3759/4088,

Schwartz, Kevin S. McKelvey, David E. Calkin, Claire A. Montgomery","The conservation of wildlife corridors between existing habitat preserves is important for combating the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation facing species of concern.  We introduce the Steiner Multigraph Problem to model the problem of minimum-cost wildlife corridor design for multiple species with different landscape requirements.  This problem can also model other analogous settings in wireless and social networks.  As a generalization of Steiner forest, the goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph that connects multiple sets of terminals.  In contrast to Steiner forest, each set of terminals can only be connected via a subset of the nodes.  Generalizing Steiner forest in this way makes the problem NP-hard even when restricted to two pairs of terminals.  However, we show that if the node subsets have a nested structure, the problem admits a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm in the number of terminals.  We successfully test exact and heuristic solution approaches on a wildlife corridor instance for wolverines and lynx in western Montana, showing that though the problem is computationally hard, heuristics perform well, and provably optimal solutions can still be obtained.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3768/4084,
213,2011,Special Track on  Computational Sustainability and AI,Hybrid Planning with Temporally Extended Goals for Sustainable Ocean Observing,"Hui Li, Brian Williams","A challenge to modeling and monitoring the health of the ocean environment is that it is largely under sensed and difficult to sense remotely. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can improve observability, for example of algal bloom regions, ocean acidification, and ocean circulation. This AUV paradigm, however, requires robust operation that is cost effective and responsive to the environment. To achieve low cost we generate operational sequences automatically from science goals, and achieve robustness by reasoning about the discrete and continuous effects of actions. We introduce Kongming2, a generative planner for hybrid systems with temporally extended goals (TEGs) and temporally flexible actions. It takes as input high level goals and outputs trajectories and actions of the hybrid system, for example an AUV. Kongming2 makes two major extensions to Kongming1: planning for TEGs, and planning with temporally flexible actions. We demonstrated a proof of concept of the planner in the Atlantic ocean on Odyssey IV, an AUV designed and built by the MIT AUV Lab at Sea Grant.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3667/4081,

To solve such large MDPs, we identify and leverage linearity in state and action sets that is common in resource management. In particular, we introduce linear dynamic programs (LDPs) that generalize resource management problems and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). We show that the LDP framework makes it possible to adapt point-based methods--the state of the art in solving POMDPs--to solving LDPs. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach in managing the water level of a river reservoir.

216,2011,Special Track on  Computational Sustainability and AI,Logistic Methods for Resource Selection Functions and Presence-Only Species Distribution Models,"Steven Phillips, Jane Elith","In order to better protect and conserve biodiversity, ecologists use machine learning and statistics to understand how species respond to their environment and to predict how they will respond to future climate change, habitat loss and other threats. A fundamental modeling task is to estimate the probability that a given species is present in (or uses) a site, conditional on environmental variables such as precipitation and temperature. For a limited number of species, survey data consisting of both presence and absence records are available, and can be used to fit a variety of conventional classification and regression models. For most species, however, the available data consist only of occurrence records --- locations where the species has been observed. In two closely-related but separate bodies of ecological literature, diverse special-purpose models have been developed that contrast occurrence data with a random sample of available environmental conditions. The most widespread statistical approaches involve either fitting an exponential model of species' conditional probability of presence, or fitting a naive logistic model in which the random sample of available conditions is treated as absence data; both approaches have well-known drawbacks, and do not necessarily produce valid probabilities. After summarizing existing methods, we overcome their drawbacks by introducing a new scaled binomial loss function for estimating an underlying logistic model of species presence/absence. Like the Expectation-Maximization approach of Ward et al. and the method of Steinberg and Cardell, our approach requires an estimate of population prevalence, $\Pr(y=1)$, since prevalence is not identifiable from occurrence data alone. In contrast to the latter two methods, our loss function is straightforward to integrate into a variety of existing modeling frameworks such as generalized linear and additive models and boosted regression trees. We also demonstrate that approaches by Lele and Keim and by Lancaster and Imbens that surmount the identifiability issue by making parametric data assumptions do not typically produce valid probability estimates.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3657/4080,

Unfortunately, current surveys tend to be slow and expensive, and hence also tend to gather insufficient quantities of data. In this work we describe three general methods for improving the use of survey resources by performing data collection with mobile devices and by directing survey progress through the application of AI techniques. First, we describe a spatial disease density model based on Gaussian process ordinal regression, which offers a better representation of the disease level distribution, as compared to the statistical approaches typically applied. Second, we show how this model can be used to dynamically route survey teams to obtain the most valuable survey possible given a fixed budget. Third, we demonstrate that the diagnosis of plant disease can be automated using images taken by a camera phone, enabling data collection by survey workers with only basic training. We have applied our methods to the specific challenge of viral cassava disease monitoring in Uganda, for which we have implemented a real-time mobile survey system that will soon see practical use.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3777/4083,
218,2011,Special Track on  Computational Sustainability and AI,Learned Behaviors of Multiple Autonomous Agents in Smart Grid Markets,"Prashant P. Reddy, Manuela M. Veloso","One proposed approach to managing a large complex Smart Grid is through Broker Agents who buy electrical power from distributed producers, and also sell power to consumers, via a Tariff Market--a new market mechanism where Broker Agents publish concurrent bid and ask prices. A key challenge is the specification of the market strategy that the Broker Agents should use in order to earn profits while maintaining the market's balance of supply and demand. Interestingly, previous work has shown that a Broker Agent can learn its strategy, using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Q-learning, and outperform other Broker Agents that use predetermined or randomized strategies. In this work, we investigate the more representative scenario in which multiple Broker Agents, instead of a single one, are independently learning their strategies. Using a simulation environment based on real data, we find that Broker Agents who employ periodic increases in exploration achieve higher rewards. We also find that varying levels of market dominance in customer allocation models result in remarkably distinct outcomes in market prices and aggregate Broker Agent rewards. The latter set of results can be explained by established economic principles regarding the emergence of monopolies in market-based competition, further validating our approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3773/4082,

Energy-optimal routing for electric vehicles creates novel algorithmic challenges, as simply understanding edge costs as energy values and applying standard algorithms does not work. First, edge costs can be negative due to recuperation, excluding Dijkstra-like algorithms. Second, edge costs may depend on parameters such as vehicle weight only known at query time, ruling out existing preprocessing techniques. Third, considering battery capacity limitations implies that the cost of a path is no longer just the sum of its edge costs. This paper shows how these challenges can be met within the framework of A* search. We show how the specific domain gives rise to a consistent heuristic function yielding an O(n2) routing algorithm. Moreover, we show how battery constraints can be treated by dynamically adapting edge costs and hence can be handled in the same way as parameters given at query time, without increasing run-time complexity.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology for quantifying multiple environmental impacts of a product, across its entire life cycle — from creation to use to discard. The key object of interest in LCA is the inventory tree, with the desired product as the root node and the materials and processes used across its life cycle as the children. The total impact of the parent in any environmental category is a linear combination of the impacts of the children in that category. LCA has generally been used in ""forward: mode: given an inventory tree and impact factors of its children, the task is to compute the impact factors of the root, i.e., the product being modeled. We propose a data mining approach to solve the inverse problem, where the task is to infer inventory trees from a database of environmental factors. This is an important problem with applications in not just understanding what parts and processes constitute a product but also in designing and developing more sustainable alternatives. Our solution methodology is one of feature selection but set in the context of a non-negative least squares problem. It organizes numerous non-negative least squares fits over the impact factor database into a set of pairwise membership relations which are then summarized into candidate trees in turn yielding a consensus tree.

Our approach uses an adaptive pricing scheme that energy suppliers apply to home smart agents controlling micro-storage devices. In particular, we prove that the interaction between a supplier using our pricing scheme and the actions of selfish micro-storage agents forms a globally stable feedback loop that converges to an efficient equilibrium. We further propose a market strategy that allows the supplier to reduce wholesale purchasing costs without increasing the uncertainty and variance for its aggregate consumer demand. Moreover, we empirically evaluate our mechanism (based on the UK grid data) and show that it yields savings of up to 16% in energy cost for consumers using storage devices with average capacity 10 kWh.

In modeling human decision making, a key factor is the psychological phenomenon known as ""framing"", in which the preferences of a decision maker change in response to contextual changes in decision problems. Existing approaches treat framing as a one-dimensional contextual influence based on the perception of outcomes as either gains or losses. However, empirical studies have shown that framing effects are much more multifaceted than one-dimensional views of framing suggest. To address this limitation, we propose an integrative approach to modeling framing which combines the psychological principles of cognitive appraisal theories and decision-theoretic notions of utility and probability. We show that this approach allows for both the identification and computation of the salient contextual factors in a decision as well as modeling how they ultimately affect the decision process. Furthermore, we show that our multi-dimensional, appraisal-based approach can account for framing effects identified in the empirical literature which cannot be addressed by one-dimensional theories, thereby promising more accurate models of human behavior.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3738/4097,

Laird","Action modeling is an important skill for agents that must perform tasks in novel domains. Previous work on action modeling has focused on learning STRIPS operators in discrete, relational domains. There has also been a separate vein of work in continuous function approximation for use in optimal control in robotics. Most real world domains are grounded in continuous dynamics but also exhibit emergent regularities at an abstract relational level of description. These two levels of regularity are often difficult to capture using a single action representation and learning method. In this paper we describe a system that combines discrete and continuous action modeling techniques in the Soar cognitive architecture. Our system accepts a continuous state representation from the environment and derives a relational state on top of it using spatial relations. The dynamics over each representation is learned separately using two simple instance-based algorithms. The predictions from the individual models are then combined in a way that takes advantage of the information captured by each representation. We empirically show that this combined model is more accurate and generalizable than each of the individual models in a spatial navigation domain.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3679/4098,

However, particle filters fare poorly at determining the robot's position without a good initial hypothesis. This problem has been addressed for robots that sense visual landmarks with sensor resetting, by performing sensor-based resampling when the robot is lost. For robots that make sparse, ambiguous and noisy observations, standard sensor resetting places new location hypotheses across a wide region, in positions that may be inconsistent with previous observations. We propose Multi-Observation Sensor Resetting, where observations from multiple frames are merged to generate new hypotheses more effectively. We demonstrate experimentally in the robot soccer domain on the NAO humanoid robots that Multi-Observation Sensor Resetting converges more efficiently to the robot's true position than standard sensor resetting, and is more robust to systematic vision errors.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3749/4117,

The tree structure enables both scalable training and testing, allowing us to solve recognition over thousands of object poses in near real-time. Moreover, by simultaneously optimizing all three tasks, our approach outperforms standard nearest neighbor and 1-vs-all classifications, with large improvements on pose recognition. We evaluate the proposed technique on a dataset of 300 household objects collected using a Kinect-style 3D camera.

To model these two types of observations in a principled statistical manner, we propose a novel methodology based on integral kernels. We show that integral kernels can be directly incorporated into a Gaussian process classification (GPC) framework to provide a continuous non-parametric Bayesian estimation of occupancy.

Our system performs inference in the model to successfully find and execute plans corresponding to natural language commands such as ""Put the tire pallet on the truck."" The model is trained using a corpus of commands collected using crowdsourcing. We pair each command with robot actions and use the corpus to learn the parameters of the model.

We introduce a new modeling technique that adaptively balances exploitability and risk reduction. An opponent’s strategy is modeled with a set of possible strategies that contain the actual strategy with a high probability. The algorithm is safe as the expected payoff is above the minimax payoff with a high probability, and can exploit the opponents’ preferences when sufficient observations have been obtained. We apply them to normal-form games and stochastic games with a finite number of stages. The  performance of the proposed approach is first demonstrated on repeated rock-paper-scissors games. Subsequently, the approach is evaluated in a human-robot table-tennis setting where the robot player learns to prepare to return a served ball. By modeling the human players, the robot chooses a forehand, backhand or middle preparation pose before they serve.

241,2011,Special Track on New Scientific and Technical Advances in Research,New Expressive Languages for Ontological Query Answering,"Andrea Calì, Georg Gottlob, Andreas Pieris","Ontology-based data access is a powerful form of extending database technology, where a classical extensional database (EDB) is enhanced by an ontology that generates new intensional knowledge which may contribute to answer a query. Recently, the Datalog+/- family of ontology languages was introduced; in Datalog+/-, rules are tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), i.e., Datalog rules with the possibility of having existentially-quantified variables in the head. In this paper we introduce a novel Datalog+/- language, namely sticky sets of TGDs, which allows for a wide class of joins in the body, while enjoying at the same time a low query-answering complexity. We establish complexity results for answering conjunctive queries under sticky sets of TGDs, showing, in particular, that ontological conjunctive queries can be compiled into first-order and thus SQL queries over the given EDB instance. We also show some extensions of sticky sets of TGDs, and how functional dependencies and so-called negative constraints can be added to a sticky set of TGDs without increasing the complexity of query answering. Our language thus properly generalizes both classical database constraints and most widespread tractable description logics.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3620/4105,

We study the possibilities of efficient, provably correct, large-scale learning in such settings. The main theme we would like to establish is that large amounts of examples can compensate for the lack of full information on each individual example. The type of partial information we consider can be due to inherent noise or from constraints on the type of interaction with the data source. In particular, we describe and analyze algorithms for budgeted learning, in which the learner can only view a few attributes of each training example, and algorithms for learning kernel-based predictors, when  individual examples are corrupted by random noise.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3121/4100,

The end result of the value creation process is two pronged: firstly, there is a cumulative value created due to the interactions and secondly, a network that captures the pattern of historical interactions between the agents. In this paper we summarize our efforts towards design and analysis of value creation networks: 1) network representation of interactions and value creations, 2) identify contribution of a node based on values created from various activities, and 3) ranking nodes based on structural properties of interactions and the resulting values.

The RPM is considered to be one of the premier psychometric measures of general intelligence. Current computational accounts of the RPM assume that visual test inputs are translated into propositional representations before further reasoning takes place.

Although a significant improvement has been made in the past, the accuracy of detecting P300 is limited by the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio in EEGs. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to optimize the interface using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).

However, specific subareas of AI have been eager to abandon general-purpose knowledge representation in favor of methods that seem to address their computational core problems better. In planning, for example, state-space search has in the last several years been preferred to logic-based methods such as SAT. In our recent work, we have demonstrated that the observed performance differences between SAT and specialized state-space search methods largely go back to the difference between a blind (or at least planning-agnostic) and a planning-specific search method. If SAT search methods are given even simple heuristics which make the search goal-directed, the efficiency differences disappear.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3669/4110,

Loops in a plan help increase both its applicability and the compactness of representation. However, progress in finding such plans has been limited largely due to lack of methods for reasoning about the correctness and safety properties of loops of actions.

Although an end user can improve the learning algorithm by labeling more training data, this process is time consuming and too ad hoc to target a particular area of inaccuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a new learning algorithm based on Locally Weighted Logistic Regression for feature labeling by end users, enabling them to point out which features are important for a class, rather than provide new training instances. In our user study, the first allowing ordinary end users to freely choose features to label directly from text documents, our algorithm was more effective than others at leveraging end users’ feature labels to improve the learning algorithm. Our results strongly suggest that allowing users to freely choose features to label is a promising method for allowing end users to improve learning algorithms effectively.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3658/4108,

We build on these notions to provide a means of obstructing such breaches by framing it as a multi-class classification problem.  Our system gives users fine-grained control over the level of privacy needed to obstruct sensitive concepts present in that data.  Additionally, our system is designed to respect a user-defined utility metric on the data (such as disclosure of a particular concept), which our methods try to maximize while anonymizing. We describe our redaction framework, algorithms, as well as a prototype tool built in to Microsoft Word that allows enterprise users to  redact documents before sharing them internally and obscure client specific information. In addition we show experimental evaluation using publicly available data sets that show the effectiveness of our approach against both automated attackers and human subjects.The results show that we are able to preserve the utility of a text corpus while reducing disclosure risk of the sensitive concept.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI-11/paper/viewFile/3528/4031,

We specifically consider dual parented networks whereby each customer must be associated with two metro nodes. An important property of such a placement is resilience to single node failure. Therefore excess capacity should be provided at each metro node in order to ensure that customers can be redistributed amongst the metro sites. Our application, as well as finding optimal node placements, can compute the minimum level of excess capacity on all metro nodes. In this paper we present three alternative approaches to optimal metro node placement.We present a detailed analysisof the impact of different placement approaches on the distribution of excess capacity throughout the network.

In this paper, we introduce the SCARE-S2 software tool which applies geospatial abduction to the environment of Afghanistan.  Unlike previous work, where we looked for small weapon caches supporting local attacks, here we look for insurgent high-value targets (HVT's), supporting insurgent operations in two provinces.  These HVT's include the locations of insurgent leaders and major supply depots.  Applying this method of inference to Afghanistan introduces several practical issues not addressed in previous work.  Namely, we are conducting inference in a much larger area (24,940 sq km as compared to 675 sq km in previous work), on more varied terrain, and must consider the influence of many local tribes.  We address all of these problems and evaluate our software on 6 months of real-world counter-insurgency data.

We are extending RUR-PLE to develop the Playing to Program (PtP) ITS, which consists of three components: (1) a Bayesian student model that tracks student competence, (2) a diagnosis module that provides tailored feedback to students, and (3) a problem selection module that guides the student’s learning process. In this paper, we summarize RUR-PLE and the PtP design, and describe an ongoing user study to evaluate the predictive accuracy of our student modeling approach.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/EAAI/EAAI11/paper/viewFile/3497/4010,

As a first step, we address problems in which these processes can be approximated by linear models that vary smoothly over time. To facilitate estimation of these linear models, we introduce a method of dimension reduction which significantly reduces error when models are estimated locally for each point in time.

While the rules of play are very simple, the state space for even small games is extremely large, and finding the outcome under optimal play is correspondingly hard. In this paper we introduce a Dots-And-Boxes solver which is significantly faster than the current state-of-the-art: over an order-of-magnitude faster on several large problems. We describe our approach, which uses Alpha-Beta search and applies a number of techniques—both problem-specific and general—to reduce the number of duplicate states explored and reduce the search space to a manageable size. Using these techniques, we have determined for the first time that Dots- And-Boxes on a board of 4x5 boxes is a tie given optimal play.

The complexity of such systems comes not only from the number of their elements, but also from the unavoidable emergence of new properties of the system, which are not just a simple summation of the properties of its elements. The behavior of complex systems can be fitted with a number of well developed models, which, however, do not incorporate the modularity and the evolution of a system simultaneously. In this work, we propose a generalized model that addresses this issue.

In video games, this includes being aware to some extent of the intentions of the opponents.  Such high-level awareness hinges upon inferences over the lower-level situation awareness provided by the game state.  Traditional plan recognizers are completely passive processes that leave all the initiative to the observed agent.  In a situation where the opponent's intentions are unclear, the observer is forced to wait until further observations of the opponent's actions are made to disambiguate the pending goal hypotheses.  With the plan recognizer we propose, in contrast, the observer would take the initiative and provoke the opponent, with the expectation that his reaction will give cues as to what his true intentions actually are.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3442/4162,

284,2011,Student Abstracts and Posters,Heuristic Planning in Adversarial Dynamic Domains,"Simon Chamberland, Froduald Kabanza","Agents in highly dynamic adversarial domains, such as RTS games, must continually make time-critical decisions to adapt their behaviour to the changing environment. In such a context, the planning agent must consider his opponent's actions as uncontrollable, or at best influenceable. In general nondeterministic domains where there is no clear turn-taking protocol, most heuristic search methods to date do not explicitly reason about the opponent's actions when guiding the state space exploration towards goal or high-reward states. In contrast, we are investigating a domain-independent heuristic planning approach which reasons about the dynamics and uncontrollability of the opponent's behaviours in order to provide better guidance to the search process of the planner. Our planner takes as input the opponent's behaviours recognized by a plan recognition module and uses them to identify opponent's actions that lead to low-utility projected states. We believe such explicit heuristic reasoning about the potential behaviours of the opponent is crucial when planning in adversarial domains, yet is missing in today's planning approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3492/4147,

State explosion rapidly occupies memory and increases computation time. Although various heuristic search algorithms have been developed to solve problems in a reasonable time, there is no efficient method to construct heuristic functions. In this work, we propose a method by which a neural network can be iteratively trained to form an efficient heuristic function. An adaptive heuristic search procedure is involved in the training iterations. This procedure reduces the evaluation values of the states that are involved in the currently known best solution paths. By doing so, the promising states are continuously moved forward. The adapted heuristic values are fed back to neural networks; thus, a well-trained network function can find the near-best solutions quickly. To demonstrate this method, we solved the fifteen-puzzle problem. Experimental results showed that the solutions obtained by our method were very close to the shortest path, and both the number of explored nodes and the search time were significantly reduced.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3476/4153,

The approach is to first search for a high probability deterministic plan using a classical planner. A novel probabilistic plan graph heuristic is used to guide the search towards high probability plans. The resulting plans can be used in a system that handles unexpected outcomes by runtime replanning. The plans can also be incrementally augmented with contingency branches for the most critical action outcomes.

290,2011,Student Abstracts and Posters,Efficient Issue-Grouping Approach for Multi-Issues Negotiation between Exaggerator Agents,"Katsuhide Fujita, Takayuki Ito, Mark Klein","Most real-world negotiation involves multiple interdependent issues, which makes an agent's utility functions complex. Traditional negotiation mechanisms, which were designed for linear utilities, do not fare well in nonlinear contexts. One of the main challenges in developing effective nonlinear negotiation protocols is scalability; it can be extremely difficult to find high-quality solutions when there are many issues, due to computational intractability. One reasonable approach to reducing computational cost, while maintaining good quality outcomes, is to decompose the contract space into several largely independent sub-spaces. In this paper, we propose a method for decomposing a contract space into sub-spaces based on the agent's utility functions. A mediator finds sub-contracts in each sub-space based on votes from the agents, and combines the sub-contracts to produce the final agreement. We demonstrate, experimentally, that our protocol allows high-optimality outcomes with greater scalability than previous efforts. We also address incentive compatibility issues. Any voting scheme introduces the potential for strategic non-truthful voting by the agents, and our method is no exception. For example, one of the agents may always vote truthfully, while the other exaggerates so that its votes are always ""strong."" It has been shown that this biases the negotiation outcomes to favor the exaggerator, at the cost of reduced social welfare. We employ the limitation of strong votes to the method of decomposing the contract space into several largely independent sub-spaces. We investigate whether and how this approach can be applied to the method of decomposing a contract space.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3554/4124,

In this class, the variable ordering for the broken-triangle property must be same as that in the prefix of the QCSP. Second, we break this restriction to allow that existentially quantified variables can be shifted within or out of their blocks, and thus identify some novel tractable classes by introducing the broken-angle property. Finally, we identify a more generalized tractable class, i.e., the min-of-max extendable class for QCSPs.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3507/4144,

In this abstract we present a role-based approach for ad hoc teamwork, in which each teammate is inferred to be following a specialized role that accomplishes a specific task or exhibits a particular behavior. In such cases, the role an ad hoc agent should select depends both on its own capabilities and on the roles currently selected by the other team members. We present methods for evaluating the influence of the ad hoc agent's role selection on the team's utility and we examine empirically how to select the best suited method for role assignment in a complex environment.

In addition, several of these semantic types have multiple heterogeneous representations, while sharing syntactic structure with other types. In this work, we propose a new approach to use conditional random fields (CRFs) to perform semantic annotation of structured data that takes advantage of the structure and labels of the tokens for higher accuracy of field labeling, while still allowing the use of exact inference techniques.

To improve the solution efficiency for multi-fault diagnosis problems, especially for large scale systems, this paper proposes a method to induce reasonable diagnosis solutions, under coarse diagnosis, by using the relationships between system outputs and components. Compared to existing diagnosis methods, the proposed framework only needs to consider associations between outputs and components by using an assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS) [de Kleer 1986] to obtain correlation components for every output node. As a result, our method significantly reduces the number of variables required for model diagnosis, which makes it suitable for large scale circuit systems.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3451/4157,

Most previous MIL algorithms, which tackle classification problems, consider each instance as a represented feature. Although the algorithms work well in some prediction problems, considering diverse features to represent an instance may provide more significant information for learning task. Moreover, since each instance may be mapped into diverse feature spaces, encountering a large number of irrelevant or redundant features is inevitable. In this paper, we propose a method to select relevant instances and concurrently consider multiple features for each instance, which is termed as MIL-MFS. MIL-MFS is based on multiple kernel learning (MKL), and it iteratively selects the fusing multiple features for classifier training.

More informed systems are more susceptible to the discretization effect, and in our experiments the more informed system makes poorer predictions.

Despite its popular usage in many real-world applications, existing research is mainly concerned with studying unstable learners as the key to ensure the performance gain of a bagging predictor, with many key factors remaining unclear. For example, it is not clear when a bagging predictor can outperform a single learner and what is the expected performance gain when different learning algorithms were used to form a bagging predictor. In this paper, we carry out comprehensive empirical studies to evaluate bagging predictors by using 12 different learning algorithms and 48 benchmark data-sets. Our analysis uses robustness and stability decompositions to characterize different learning algorithms, through which we rank all learning algorithms and comparatively study their       bagging predictors to draw conclusions. Our studies assert that both stability and robustness are key requirements to ensure the high performance for building a bagging predictor.

Elderly tend to lead an isolated life away from their offspring; however, they may fear being unable to obtain help if they are injured or ill. During the last decades, this fear has generated research attempts to find assistive technologies for making living of elderly people at homes easier and independent, as is the aim of this research work. Research study proposes a generalized approach to an intelligent and ubiquitous care system to recognize a few of the most common and important health problems of the elderly, which can be detected by analyzing their movement. In the event that the system was to recognize a health problem, it would automatically notify a physician with an included explanation of the automatic diagnosis. It is two-step approach; in the first step it classifies person's activities into five activities: fall, unconscious fall, walking, standing/sitting, lying down/lying. In the second step, it classifies walking patterns into five different health states; one healthy and four unhealthy: hemiplegia (usually the result of stroke), Parkinson’s disease, leg pain and back pain. Moreover, since elderly having these health problems are less stable and more prone to falls, recognizing them leads not only to detection but indirectly also to prevention of falls of elderly people. In the initial approach movement of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of the tags attached to the body, whose coordinates are acquired by the sensors situated in the apartment. In the current approach wearable inertial sensors are used, allowing monitoring inside or outside of the buildings.

This allows to augment the model with advantageous sparse priors provided by the RVM's regression framework. We have also taken into account the significant issue of selecting the proper parameters of the kernel design matrix. Experiments have shown that our method produces improved performance in both simulated and real test environments.,https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3436/4161,
312,2011,Student Abstracts and Posters,A Framework for Integration of Logical and Probabilistic Knowledge,"Jingsong Wang, Marco Valtorta","Integrating the expressive power of first-order logic with the ability of probabilistic reasoning of Bayesian networks has attracted the interest of many researchers for decades. We present an approach to integration that translates logical knowledge into Bayesian networks and uses Bayesian network composition to build a uniform representation that supports both logical and probabilistic reasoning. In particular, we propose a new way of translation of logical knowledge, relation search. Through the use of the proposed framework, without learning new languages or tools, modelers are allowed to 1) specify special knowledge using the most suitable languages, while reasoning in a uniform engine; 2) make use of pre-existing logical knowledge bases for probabilistic reasoning (to complete the model or minimize potential inconsistencies).",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3499/4143,
313,2011,Student Abstracts and Posters,Solution Quality Improvements for Massively Multi-Agent Pathfinding,"Ko-Hsin Cindy Wang, Adi Botea, Philip Kilby","MAPP has been previously shown as a state-of-the-art multi-agent path planning algorithm on criteria including scalability and success ratio (i.e., percentage of solved units) on realistic game maps. MAPP further provides a formal characterization of problems it can solve, and low-polynomial upper bounds on the resources required. However, until now, MAPP's solution quality had not been extensively analyzed. In this work we empirically analyze the quality of MAPP's solutions, using multiple quality criteria such as the total travel distance, the makespan and the sum of actions (including move and wait actions). We also introduce enhancements that improve MAPP's solution quality significantly. For example, the sum of actions is cut to half on average. The improved MAPP is competitive in terms of solution quality with FAR and WHCA*, two successful algorithms from the literature, and maintains its advantages on different performance criteria, such as scalability, success ratio, and ability to tell apriori if it will succeed in the instance at hand. As optimal algorithms have limited scalability, evaluating the quality of the solutions provided by suboptimal algorithms is another important topic. Using lower bounds of optimal values, we show that MAPP's solutions have a reasonable quality. For example, MAPP's total travel distance is on average 19% longer than a lower bound on the optimal value.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3450/4158,

It allows a player to adapt its strategy in order to better respond to the presumed preferences of its opponents. We introduce a modeling technique that adaptively balances safety and exploitability. The opponent's strategy is modeled with a set of possible strategies that contains the actual one with high probability. The algorithm is safe as the expected payoff is above the minimax payoff with high probability, and can exploit the opponent's preferences when sufficient observations are obtained. We apply the algorithm to a robot table-tennis setting where the robot player learns to prepare to return a served ball. By modeling the human players, the robot chooses a forehand, backhand or middle preparation pose before they serve. The learned strategies can exploit the opponent's preferences, leading to a higher rate of successful returns.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3510/4136,

317,2011,Student Abstracts and Posters,A Local Monte Carlo Tree Search Approach in Deterministic Planning,"Fan Xie, Hootan Nakhost, Martin Müller","Much recent work in satisficing planning has aimed at striking a balance between coverage - solving as many problems as possible - and plan quality. Current planners achieve near perfect coverage on the latest IPC benchmarks. It is therefore natural to investigate their scaling behavior on more difficult instances. Among state of the art planners, LAMA (Richter, Helmert, and Westphal 2008) is able to generate high quality plans, but its coverage drops off rapidly with increasing prob- lem complexity. The Arvand planner (Nakhost and Müller 2009) scales to much harder instances but generates lower quality plans. This paper introduces a new algorithm, Monte Carlo Random Walk-based Local Tree Search (MRW-LTS), which uses random walks to selectively build local search trees. Experiments demonstrate that MRW-LTS combines a scaling behavior that is better than LAMA’s with a plan quality that is better than Arvand’s.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3468/4154,
318,2011,Student Abstracts and Posters,Discovering Latent Strategies,Xiaoxi Xu,"Strategy mining is a new area of research about discovering strategies in decision-making. In this paper, we formulate the strategy-mining problem as a clustering problem, called the latent-strategy problem. In a latent-strategy problem, a corpus of data instances is given, each of which is represented by a set of features and a decision label. The inherent dependency of the decision label on the features is governed by a latent strategy. The objective is to find clusters, each of which contains data instances governed by the same strategy. Existing clustering algorithms are inappropriate to cluster dependency because they either assume feature independency (e.g., K-means) or only consider the co-occurrence of features without explicitly modeling the special dependency of the decision label on other features (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)). In this paper, we present a baseline unsupervised learning algorithm for dependency clustering. Our model-based clustering algorithm iterates between an assignment step and a minimization step to learn a mixture of decision tree models that represent latent strategies. Similar to the Expectation Maximization algorithm, our algorithm is grounded in the statistical learning theory. Different from other clustering algorithms, our algorithm is irrelevant-feature resistant and its learned clusters (modeled by decision trees) are strongly interpretable and predictive. We systematically evaluate our algorithm using a common law dataset comprised of actual cases. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms K-means and LDA on clustering dependency.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3532/4134,

The language AC(C) is designed to integrate ASP and CLP. Compared with existing integration of ASP and CSP, AC(C) allows representing user-defined constraints. Such integration provides great power for applications requiring logical reasoning involving constraints, e.g., temporal planning. In AC(C), user-defined and primitive constraints can be solved by a CLP inference engine while the logical reasoning over those constraints and regular logic literals is solved by an ASP inference engine (i.e., solver). My PhD work includes improving the language AC(C), implementing its faster inference engine and investigating how effective the new system can be used to solve a challenging application, temporal planning.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC11/paper/viewFile/3552/4049,

321,2011,General Papers,Model Update for Automated Planning,"Maria Viviane de Menezes, Leliane Nunes de Barros","Model update is a formal approach to correct a system model M w.r.t some property not satisfied by M. In this work, we show how this formal approach can be used for plan and planning domain verification and update. While a model checking method can directly be used to perform plan verification, model update techniques can be used to either update an incorrect plan and\or update a planning domain specification. Well known model update approaches are based on CTL — a logic which does not take into account the actions. In previous work, we have proposed the alpha-CTL logic, a logic whose semantics is based on actions. Here, we are proposing a model update system based on alpha-CTL which is able to automatically modify a plan M, generating a new plan M' that satisfies phi or, if there is not such a plan, to automatically update the corresponding planning domain.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC11/paper/viewFile/3536/4047,

323,2011,General Papers,Ensemble Classification for Relational Domains,Hoda Eldardiry,"Ensemble classification methods have been shown to produce more accurate predictions than the base component models. Due to their effectiveness, ensemble approaches have been applied in a wide range of domains to improve classification. The expected prediction error of classification models can be decomposed into bias and variance. Ensemble methods that independently construct component models (e.g., bagging) can improve performance by reducing the error due to variance, while methods that dependently construct component models (e.g., boosting) can improve performance by reducing the error due to bias and variance. Although ensemble methods were initially developed for classification of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, they can be directly applied for relational data by using a relational classifier as the base component model. This straightforward approach can improve classification for network data, but suffers from a number of limitations. First, relational data characteristics will only be exploited by the base relational classifier, and not by the ensemble algorithm itself. We note that explicitly accounting for the structured nature of relational data by the ensemble mechanism can significantly improve ensemble classification. Second, ensemble learning methods that assume i.i.d. data can fail to preserve the relational structure of non-i.i.d. data, which will (1) prevent the relational base classifiers from exploiting these structures, and (2) fail to accurately capture properties of the dataset, which can lead to inaccurate models and classifications. Third, ensemble mechanisms that assume i.i.d. data are limited to reducing errors associated with i.i.d. models and fail to reduce additional sources of error associated with more powerful (e.g., collective classification models. Our key observation is that collective classification methods have error due to variance in inference. This has been overlooked by current ensemble methods that assume exact inference methods and only focus on the typical goal of reducing errors due to learning, even if the methods explicitly consider relational data. Here we study the problem of ensemble classification for relational domains by focusing on the reduction of error due to variance. We propose a relational ensemble framework that explicitly accounts for the structured nature of relational data during both learning and inference. Our proposed framework consists of two components. (1) A method for learning accurate ensembles from relational data, focusing on the reduction of error due to variance in learning, while preserving the relational characteristics in the data. (2) A method for applying ensembles in collective classification contexts, focusing on further reduction of the error due to variance in inference, which has not been considered in state of the art ensemble methods.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC11/paper/viewFile/3518/4043,

326,2011,General Papers,Designing Water Efficient Residential Landscapes with Agent-Based Modeling,Rhonda Hoenigman,"The focus of my research is an agent-based system for optimizing spatial arrangements of plants on a landscape to maximize their growth and minimize their water use. The optimization criteria include a natural phenomenon known as facilitation, which is observed in water-scarce environments when larger shrubs serve as benefactors to smaller annuals by generating conditions that protect them from harsh afternoon sun. In my modeling and optimization system each plant is an agent with growth requirements. A plant agent's fitness at a given location is defined by a fitness function that includes those growth requirements and a penalty term designed to force facilitation. The landscape design is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem with a discrete set of locations for each plant on a grid, a fixed number of plants, and a fitness function that defines the performance of a plant at a location. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, I applied a variety of search strategies, including simulated annealing and a new agent-based approach that mimics how plant communities evolve over time, to different collections of simulated plant types and landscapes and compared the fitness scores and spatial arrangments in the solutions. The fitness scores from the search strategies were comparable. The search strategies produced different spatial distributions of the larger plants, and all designs exhibited facilitation and lower water use.",https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC11/paper/viewFile/3490/4045,

332,2011,General Papers,"Learning Sensor, Space and Object Geometry",Jeremy Stober,"Robots with many sensors are capable of generating volumes of high-dimensional perceptual data. Making sense of this data and extracting useful knowledge from it is a difficult problem. For robots lacking proper models, trying to understand a stream of uninterpreted data is an especially acute problem. One critical step in linking raw uninterpreted perceptual data to cognition is dimensionality reduction. Current methods for reducing the dimension of data do not meet the demands of a robot situated in the world, and methods that use only perceptual data do not take full advantage of the interactive experience of an embodied robot agent. This work proposes a new scalable, incremental and active approach to dimensionality reduction suitable for extracting geometric knowledge from uninterpreted sensors and effectors. The proposed method uses distinctive state abstractions to organize early sensorimotor experience and sensorimotor embedding to incrementally learn accurate geometric representations based on experience. This approach is applied to the problem of learning the geometry of sensors, space, and objects.
